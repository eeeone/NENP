Most arthropods, however, need shelter habitats for overwintering embedded in agricultural landscapes. Habitats created by perennial agri-environmental schemes (AES) such as flowering fields can provide such overwintering places in addition to nesting sites and food resources. However, it is unclear, to which extent arthropods use such flowering fields for overwintering. We assessed the emergence of six functionally relevant arthropod groups (wild bees, hoverflies, wasps, carabid beetles, staphylinid beetles and spiders) with emergence cages on wheat fields and on four types of flowering fields differing in temporal continuity (age and time since last soil disturbance). Wild bee richness and abundance was highest in flowering fields that had undergone soil disturbance in the previous year while recent soil disturbance was clearly detrimental. Natural enemies were mostly unaffected by temporal continuity and hoverflies emerged most abundantly from wheat fields. Carabid beetle richness and densities of carabid and staphylinid beetles were positively affected by recent soil disturbance while hoverfly densities were negatively affected. Further assemblage composition of emerging wild bees and carabid beetles differed between habitat types. Our results indicate that most natural enemies overwinter even in flowering fields with low temporal continuity and recent soil disturbance while wild bees need habitats of higher temporal continuity for overwintering. We thus propose a mix of flowering habitats with different degrees of temporal continuity embedded in the agricultural landscape to make AES more effective towards the provisioning of overwintering sites for ecosystem service providers. We conclude that a better understanding of the overwintering ecology of different arthropod groups is required to counteract current biodiversity decline in agricultural landscapes.",Ecological intensification; Flower strips; Set aside fields; Insect and emergence traps; Pest control; Pollination,SOWN WILDFLOWER STRIPS; SEMINATURAL HABITATS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BEE and COMMUNITIES; ARABLE FIELDS; NESTING BEES; BIODIVERSITY; EMERGENCE; and CONSERVATION; BEETLES,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,330,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,University of Wurzburg,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,8,TRUE,NA,AV,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To preserve taxonomic diversity in agricultural landscapes, there is an increasing need for refuge areas within agroecosystems, but best practices for providing such sites are debated. Here, we compared the taxonomic diversity and trait composition of spiders, being important terrestrial predators, among cereal fields, grassy field margins, set aside fields sown with wildflowers, and semi-natural sites within an agricultural landscape in western Germany. Spider taxonomic diversity was similarly high in all non-crop habitats, indicating a surprisingly high value of field margins and setaside fields. Cereal fields, in contrast, were dominated by a few, mainly euryecious species. Moreover, community mean body size was smallest on cereal fields but highest on semi-natural sites, suggesting that spider body size may serve as a valuable indicator of the level of anthropogenic disturbance.

The wildflower strips in field margin could improve rural aesthetics, but their effectiveness in maintaining spider diversity remains poorly understood in China. In this study, eight pairs of focal fields with similar agricultural management and landscape composition were selected. In each pair, one field was selected next to a wildflower strip previously established as part of the focal field, and the other field next to habitats without flower resource was selected. We captured spiders in the fields to figure out factors that influence spider diversity. Wildflower strips increased cropland spider diversity, especially within the fields.

Conservation biological control addresses this problem by generally extensifying farming and/or providing alternative habitats and food sources for natural enemies of pest species. However, farmers implement conservation biological control sparingly, in part because of the confusing variety of measures with inconsistent effects. To shed some light on the effectiveness of conservation biological control measures in apple production, we conducted four meta-analyses to identify patterns of local measures on (i) insect pest abundance, (ii) natural enemy abundance, (iii) biological control, and (iv) fruit quality. Across the 54 studies, we found an overall significant, positive effect of local interventions on natural enemy abundance. Among our established intervention categories (flowers, ground cover, extensification), ground covers promoted natural enemies the most and tended to reduce pest insects. Likewise, providing flowers promoted natural enemies without affecting fruit quality. In contrast, extensification of orchard management alone, such as reducing agrochemical use and/or less disturbance, had no significant effect on the abundance of natural enemies, but showed a tendency to increase populations of pest insects and reduce fruit quality.

Due to the associated environmental impacts and consumers increasingly demanding food produced more sustainably, the tree fruit sector is seeking to reduce its reliance on PPPs. Despite intensification, apple production is still highly dependent on ecosystem services, including pest regulation and pollination. The aim of this study was to investigate the response of natural enemies and pollinators in commercial apple orchards to the provision of a wildflower habitat. It was hypothesised that the abundance and diversity of beneficial invertebrate species would be enhanced leading to an increased control of apple pests and enhanced pollination of apple blossom. We also investigated the effect of orchard pesticide toxicity on natural enemies and pest regulation services and how responses varied between apple cultivars (Jazz and Braeburn). The study was carried out in five orchards of each apple variety across Kent (UK), using a split-plot experimental design. At each site, a one-hectare orchard plot was established with wildflower strips in alleyways between rows of trees and compared with a one-hectare control plot where alleyways were managed conventionally with regular cuffing. Responses of natural enemies and pollinators were recorded over a period of three and four years, respectively. The presence of wildflower strips did not contribute significantly towards the delivery of natural pest regulation or pollination services. However, hoverfly diversity and species richness were greater in orchards with wildflower strips, and whilst this was not associated with increased rates of pest regulation, such a response could potentially provide more resilient pest regulation and pollination services. Braeburn orchards had higher bee abundance, and pest predation rates, which were associated with a greater abundance of earwigs, compared to Jazz orchards. Of key significance for growers is that high values of cumulative pesticide toxicity negatively affected natural enemy populations, especially earwigs. If growers want to support natural enemies and wild pollinators in modern apple orchards following the principles of ecological intensification, they need to consider both the types and frequency of pesticide sprays used, in conjunction with interventions aimed at promoting beneficial invertebrates.",Anthocoridae; Araneae; Coccinellidae; Dermaptera; Miridae; Neuroptera; and Syrphidae [Biological control /  / wildflower interventions] [Insect and prey / Aphidoidea (Hemiptera) / ] [Species diversity / Species richness and / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Apple orchards / ]. and Aphidoidea [Biological control /  / plant host; wildflower and interventions] [Plant hosts /  / Insect & arachnid predators] and [Population dynamics / Abundance / ] [Arachnid predators / Araneae / ] and [Insect predators / Anthocoridae (Hemiptera) / ] [ / Coccinellidae and (Coleoptera) / ] [ / Dermaptera (Dermaptera) / ] [ / Miridae (Hemiptera) and / ] [ / Neuroptera (Neuroptera) / ] [ / Syrphidae (Diptera) / ] and [Cultivated land habitat / Apple orchards / ]. and Arthropoda [Pollination /  / Pollination services; wildflower and interventions] [Species diversity / Species richness / ] [Population and dynamics / Anundance / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Apple orchards / ].,DYSAPHIS-PLANTAGINEA HEMIPTERA; SOWN FLOWER STRIPS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; and ARTHROPOD PESTS; BEE ABUNDANCE; DIVERSITY; CROPS; INSECTICIDES; and DECLINES; PREDATORS,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,301,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,University of Worcester; University of Reading,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,59,TRUE,NA,AV,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Among the natural enemies reliant on flower resources, green lacewings often stand out due to their abundance, predation capacity and polyphagy. We evaluated the impact of tailored flower strips on the enhancement of natural enemies, especially green lacewings, in three organic cabbage (Brassica oleracea) farms in Southern Sweden. Insects were sampled from the flower strips, and cabbage pests and predators were visually recorded in the crop. In a laboratory assay, the pollen feeding preferences of Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens, 1836) were evaluated in a dual-choice test. The pollen consumed by the Chrysopidae was extracted from laboratory and field specimens, then quantified and identified. Flower strips were found to attract predators and parasitoids, whose abundance increased as flowers bloomed. Cabbage plants next to the flower strips showed lower pest infestation as compared to cabbage plant control, although no significant differences were observed in the number of predators. Chrysopidae used flower strips as feeding, reproduction and shelter sites and mainly consumed pollen from Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth. Under laboratory conditions, C. carnea showed a preference for P. tanacetifolia and Coriandrum sativum L. pollen over Borago officinalis L. and Fagopyrum esculentum Moench. We show that tailored flower strips could be an efficient tool for enhancing beneficial arthropods and should be considered in integrated pest management for cabbage crops. ?? 2021, The Author(s).",Anthocoridae; Cantharidae; Chrysopidae; Coccinellidae; Deraeocoris; and Nabidae [Biological control /  / ] [Insect prey / Brevicoryne brassicae and (Hemiptera) / ] [ / Mamestra brassicae (Lepidoptera) / ] [ / Pieris and brassicae (Lepidoptera) / ] [ / Pieris rapae (Lepidoptera) / ] [ / and Pieris xylostella (Lepidoptera) / ]. and Brevicoryne brassicae; Mamestra brassicae; Pieris brassicae; Pieris and rapae; Pieris xylostella [Biological control /  / ] [ /  / ] and [Hymenopteran parasites /  / ] [Insect predators / Deraeocoris and (Hemiptera) / ] [ / Anthocoridae (Hemiptera) / ] [ / Cantharidae and (Coleoptera) / ] [ / Chrysopidae (Neuroptera) / ] [ / Coccinellidae and (Coleoptera) / ] [ / Nabidae (Hemiptera) / ]. and Chrysoperla carnea [Food plants / Borago officinalis / ] [ / Coriandrum and sativum / ] [ / Fagopyrum esculentum / ] [ / Phacelia tanacetifolia / ] and [Food preferences / Pollen feeding preferences / ] [Sweden / Scania / ]. and Hymenoptera [Biological control /  / ] [Hemipteran hosts / Brevicoryne and brassicae / ] [Lepidopteran hosts / Mamestra brassicae / ] [ / Pieris and brassicae / ] [ / Pieris rapae / ] [ / Pieris xylostella / ].,CHRYSOPERLA-CARNEA; NATURAL ENEMIES; NEUROPTERA CHRYSOPIDAE; and BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; BENEFICIAL ARTHROPODS; HABITAT MANAGEMENT; CROP and ENVIRONMENT; COMPANION PLANTS; APPLE ORCHARDS; POLLEN GRAIN,JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,95,2,669,683,Article,J,"Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion and Experimental del Zaidin (EEZ); Swedish University of Agricultural and Sciences; IRTA; Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria, and AGROSAVIA; University of Padua",Scopus,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,107,TRUE,NA,ADP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We set out to test this assumption by comparing overall and functional group-specific species richness, activity density, and assemblage composition of carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and spiders (Araneae), in three types of service strips-OSR, woody, and grassy strips established in direct vicinity to cropland. OSR strips were found to harbor the highest carabid species richness and activity density of small carabids. The activity density of carabids overall and of omnivorous species, the species richness and activity density of spiders across size classes and feeding strategies were all significantly reduced in woody strips. The percentage of seminatural habitat in the wider landscape was positively linked to the activity density of spiders overall, ground hunting and large spiders, whereas in carabids, positive effects were limited to large species occurring in grassy strips. Habitat type was the main predictor of both carabid and spider assemblage composition. Our results indicate that carabid and spider activity density across functional groups responded more strongly to changes in the landscape composition than the diversity of individual taxonomic groups. For agricultural landscape management, the establishment of habitat mosaics that include regular OSR could promote abundant, species-rich predatory invertebrates particularly in early spring.

However, predators are subject to frequent mortality events due to periodic disturbance regimes such as crop planting and harvest, which inevitably affect the population development of predators. Conservation of predators in this critical period is important for double-cropping systems such as winter wheat and summer maize, the most widely used cropping system in North China. RESULTS Planting Cnidium monnieri flower strips at field borders could not only serve as a bridge habitat to conserve the dominant predator Propylaea japonica in wheat fields during harvest but also help the predator immigrate to adjacent maize fields. The predator abundance was 7-fold higher on flower strips than that on natural vegetation strips during the wheat postharvest period and before the maize plant emergence for about a month, and its abundance in maize fields planted with flower strips was nearly 2-fold higher than that in maize fields planted with natural vegetation strips. Moreover, 77.56% of predators that entered maize fields were proven to originate from flower strips. CONCLUSION Our findings provided evidence that manipulating flower strips as a bridge habitat in wheat-maize rotation fields could conserve P. japonica during crop phenophase changes, and we quantitatively testified that the proportion of this predator in maize fields derived from flower strips.

Turfgrass supports low biodiversity compared with more diverse vegetation communities. One increasingly popular method for supporting arthropod communities in urban areas is to plant wildflowers in available spaces using a commercial seed mix, which can support beneficial insects such as butterflies, bees, and natural enemies. However, the long-term impacts of these wildflower habitats on arthropod communities in turfgrass systems is poorly known. To explore this, we used pan traps to sample insects from turfgrass systems adjacent to wildflower plots over three years and quantified how different insect groups changed in abundance. We found that different insect groups had variable changes in abundance over time, with sweat bees (Halicitdae) and skipper butterflies (Hesperiidae) being less abundant two years after wildlife implementation, and predatory flies showing boosted abundance for two years post-implementation. These results point to the complex dynamics of arthropod communities in turfgrass systems following wildflower implementation and the need to study how to best maintain these habitats to support long-term biodiversity.Abstract Urbanization is rapidly influencing the abundance and diversity of arthropods. Within urban systems, managed turfgrass is a prominent land cover which can support only a limited number of arthropod groups. To allow for more arthropod biodiversity and to support beneficial insects within turfgrass, increasing numbers of land managers are choosing to partially convert turf habitat to wildflower habitat using commercially available seed mixes. However, the population dynamics of arthropod groups in these systems are poorly known, with consequentially little information on best long-term practices for managing wildflower habitats in turfgrass systems. To address this gap, we sampled insects using pan traps in turfgrass systems pre- and post-implementation of wildflower habitats and examined the change in abundance of several insect families and functional guilds. Insect groups had variable responses to wildflower habitat implementation, with some groups such as sweat bees and skipper butterflies showing a decline two years post-implementation. Other groups, such as predatory flies, were relatively more abundant one and two years post-implementation. These variable responses point to the need for more research on the long-term effects of wildflower habitats on beneficial insects in turfgrass habitats.",turfgrass; arthropod conservation; habitat management; urban ecology; and pollinators; natural enemies,WILD BEE ABUNDANCE; GOLF-COURSES; BENEFICIAL ARTHROPODS; FLORAL and RESOURCES; NATURAL ENEMIES; PEST-CONTROL; PAN TRAPS; CONSERVATION; and DIVERSITY; HYMENOPTERA,INSECTS,15,7,NA,NA,Article,J,North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,142,TRUE,NA,ADP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, the usefulness of four flowering service plants (Lobularia maritima, Calendula officinalis, Coreopsis grandiflora, and Achillea millefolium) is evaluated for aphid infestation levels and aphid natural enemy abundances. Aphid levels were consistently lower in oleander plots surrounded by service plants. Natural enemy abundances tended to be higher in plots surrounded by service plants, but significant differences could not be found until the fourth year of the study, when more lacewings, total predators, and mummies were higher in plots surrounded by service plants. On these plots, hoverflies, ladybeetles, and lacewings were the most common predators. Paragus sp. and Hippodamia variegata were the prevalent hoverfly and ladybeetle species, respectively.

However, the factors that drive effects of roadside vegetation on pollinator abundance and pollination need further attention. Our main interest in this study was to evaluate urban roadside enhancement by identifying direct and indirect effects of local resource availability and land-scape characteristics on pollinator abundance and quality of pollination, by using functionally different phy-tometer plants. Thus, we established 34 species-rich wildflower patches along urban roads, and monitored flowering species and floral density at the local scale. At the landscape scale we measured the amount of impervious surface within a radius of 500 m around the wildflower patches, as well as edge density of all major land-use types, and distance to the city center. As control, we used 34 patches with existing species-poor roadside green. The abundance of pollinators, i.e., honeybees, wild bees, and hoverflies, was sampled with colored pan traps. Pollination was monitored based on fruit number and weight of three phytometer species, i.e., Fragaria x ananassa, Ranunculus acris, and Trifolium pratense, that differ in flower morphology and color, and attract different pollinators. Pollinator abundance was positively related to local richness of flowering plants and floral density. At the landscape scale, pollinator abundance was positively related to the proportion of impervious surface but negatively to edge density. Phytometer-specific effects on pollination were moderated by landscape characteristics: Fruit mass of F. x. ananassa was highest in the inner city, fruit number of R. acris was lower in areas with high edge density, whereas in T. pratense fruit number increased with edge density, and was nega-tively related with the proportion of impervious surface. There were no indirect effects of local and landscape factors via pollinator abundance on pollination. The study of the three phytometer species revealed that roadside enhancement can directly support fruit production in wild plants and crops in cities. Thereby, different landscape characteristics influenced the quality of fruit set, which also depended on individual plant reproductive adap-tations. This stresses the importance of using a set of complementary phytometer species in pollination experi-ments, especially to gain insights into ecosystem functioning at coarser spatial scales.","Anthophila; Apis; Syrphidae [Food availability / Floral resource and availability / phytometer-specific effects] [Pollination / Fragaria / ] and [ / Ranunculus acris / ] [ / Trifolium pratense / ] [ / Ananassa / ] and [Population density / Abundance / ] [Urban habitat / Urban roadside and vegetation landscape impacts / ] [Germany / Bavaria, Munich / ].",DIVERSITY; TRAITS; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; CITY,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,147,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,Technical University of Munich,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,171,TRUE,NA,ADP,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We established an experimental landscape consisting of 3 x 3 in plots that contained a central bed of Euonymus fortunei (Turcz.) and either a low or high density of four species of perennial flowering plants, or no flowering plants. The cultivars of perennials, Trifolium repens L., Euphorbia epithymoides L., Coreopsis verticillata L. var. 'Moonbeam,' and Solidago canadensis L. var. 'Golden Baby,' were chosen because their staggered bloom periods would provide nectar and pollen for natural enemies throughout the summer months. We used yellow sticky cards and a vacuum sampler to collect arthropods from experimental plots in 2000 to 2003. Natural enemies in general, and spiders and parasitic wasps specifically, were usually most abundant in euonymus beds surrounded by flowering plants. The number of parasitic wasps and total natural enemies on sticky cards was positively correlated with biomass of E epithlymoides within plots, and that of all flowering plants combined. Removal of inflorescences from plants in a subset of study plots did not affect patterns of natural enemy abundance or dispersion of natural enemies within the landscape, suggesting that vegetative characteristics of plants, rather than flowers, influenced the abundance of natural enemies. We conclude from these findings that the presence of floral resource plants in landscapes enhances the abundance of natural enemies. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The first 20 cm of soil were sampled in two young alley cropping sites in South-West France with sown UVSs. Tree distance did not influence studied variables within the UVS. Soil organic carbon and available phosphorus contents were significantly higher in the UVS than in the crop alley, but not soil microbial biomass and macro-invertebrate density and diversity, except for woodlice density. Earthworm distribution in ecomorphological categories differed between the UVS and the crop alley. Microbial biomass and macro-invertebrate diversity were significantly reduced 1 m away from the UVS in both sites. It was concluded that these sown UVSs were not strongly impacted by tree proximity, enriched the first 20 cm of soil with organic carbon, and provided a habitat for specific macro-invertebrates, probably due to reduced disturbance and permanent vegetation.

Aboveground and belowground forces always operate simultaneously to shape herbivore pressure, but understanding how they interact is a longstanding and persistent challenge. Here, we examine how organic composts mediate the effects of plant diversity across trophic levels, using zucchini plants (Cucurbita pepo) as a study system. Over two field seasons, we manipulated vermicompost treatments in 18 experiments in school gardens that varied in surrounding plant and floral resource diversity and measured responses of insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Vermicompost strengthened a positive relationship between flower richness and foliar-feeding omnivores, suggesting that robust reservoirs of omnivores at flower-rich sites mounted stronger responses to compost-treated host plants. Predators increased with flower richness, but were not affected by vermicompost. Net outcomes of vermicompost and plant diversity were neutral for herbivores. Synthesis and applications. Altogether, our results reveal that bottom-up factors protecting plants are modified by their environmental context, and may more effectively attract natural enemies in landscapes with diverse floral resources.

Wildflower meadows in urban areas could provide important nature-based solutions, addressing the biodiversity and climate crises jointly and benefitting society in the process. King's College Cambridge (England, UK) established a wildflower meadow over a portion of its iconic Back Lawn in 2019, replacing a fine lawn first laid in 1772.We used biodiversity surveys, Wilcoxon signed rank and ANOVA models to compare species richness, abundance and composition of plants, spiders, bugs, bats and nematodes supported by the meadow, and remaining lawn, over 3 years. We estimated the climate change impact of meadow vs lawn from maintenance emissions, soil carbon sequestration and reflectance effect. We surveyed members of the university to quantify the societal benefits of, and attitudes towards, increased meadow planting on the collegiate university estate.In spite of its small size (0.36 ha), the meadow supported approximately three times more plant species, three times more spider and bug species and individuals, and bats were recorded three times more often over the meadow than the remaining lawn. Terrestrial invertebrate biomass was 25 times higher in the meadow compared with the lawn. Fourteen species with conservation designations were recorded on the meadow (six for lawn), alongside meadow specialist species. Reduced maintenance and fertilising associated with meadow reduced emissions by an estimated 1.36 Mg CO2-e per hectare per year compared with lawn. Relative reflectance increased by 25%-34% for meadow relative to lawn. Soil carbon stocks did not differ between meadow and lawn. Respondents thought meadows provided greater aesthetic, educational and mental wellbeing services than lawns. In open responses, lawns were associated with undesirable elitism and social exclusion (most colleges in Cambridge restrict lawn access to senior members of college), and respondents proved overwhelmingly in favour of meadow planting in place of lawn on the collegiate university estate.

We investigated how features within urban environments, including floral resources and canopy cover, impacted (a) flower visitation and seed production of a model plant (Brassica rapa) and (b) total yields of produce from urban gardens in Sydney, Australia. Floral visitation to model plants was dominated by a few common species, with honeybees responsible for 53.4% of visitation and native stingless bees and two hoverfly species accounting for another 37.1% of visitors; 28 other species were collectively responsible for less than 10% of visitation. While insect pollinators were abundant, the relationship between floral visitation and model plant reproductive output was weak and not always positive. The pollination success of model plants was only marginally impacted by environmental features, while pollinator visitation had a small negative impact. However, total crop yields across urban gardens were strongly influenced by local canopy cover and garden scale plant species richness. Synthesis and applications. The factors influencing pollination service delivery to urban gardens are complex; pollinator visitation, richness and/or floral resource availability may not always reflect positive, plant reproductive outcomes. Yields of garden crops, whether pollinator dependent or not, were more strongly influenced by surrounding environmental variables, including broad scale measures of canopy cover and local plant diversity, than pollination-related metrics.

Despite societal dependence on pollinators for crop production, humankind continues to drive pollinator declines through agricultural intensification and urbanisation.
Urban environments can provide refuge to some pollinators. There is a need, however, to understand how pollinator communities can be supported in these areas while also considering human needs. Public green spaces provide a promising avenue to target plant¨Cpollinator conservation measures in an urban setting due to their large area, high abundance and low plant¨Cpollinator biodiversity.
We used a paired design to compare the plant community, pollinator community and plant¨Cpollinator interactions of (i) public urban green spaces enhanced with wildflower meadows and pollinator-friendly ornamental plantings to (ii) control unenhanced urban green spaces. The planting types within enhanced sites were also separately compared.
Our results show that not only was the diversity of the overall pollinator community higher in enhanced than control sites, but also the complexity of some wild Hymenoptera and the abundance of Diptera pollinator groups. The negative impact of urbanisation on some pollinator groups was reduced in enhanced sites compared with control sites. Planting both pollinator-friendly ornamental plants and wildflower meadows significantly increased the visits from Diptera and the diversity in the plant¨Cpollinator community compared with wildflower plantings alone.
Our results suggest that enhancing public spaces for pollinators has positive effects on key groups and can help mitigate the impacts of urbanisation.

Short mown grassland designed for recreational use is the dominant form of urban greenspace in temperate regions but requires considerable maintenance and typically provides limited habitat value for most taxa. Alternatives are increasingly proposed, but the biodiversity potential of these is not well understood. In a replicated experiment across six public urban greenspaces, we used nine different perennial meadow plantings to quantify the relative roles of floristic diversity and height of sown meadows on the richness and composition of three taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, and soil microbes. We found that all meadow treatments were colonized by plant species not sown in the plots, suggesting that establishing sown meadows does not preclude further locally determined grassland development if management is appropriate. Colonizing species were rarer in taller and more diverse plots, indicating competition may limit invasion rates. Urban meadow treatments contained invertebrate and microbial communities that differed from mown grassland. Invertebrate taxa responded to changes in both height and richness of meadow vegetation, but most orders were more abundant where vegetation height was longer than mown grassland. Order richness also increased in longer vegetation and Coleoptera family richness increased with plant diversity in summer. Microbial community composition seems sensitive to plant species composition at the soil surface (0¨C10 cm), but in deeper soils (11¨C20 cm) community variation was most responsive to plant height, with bacteria and fungi responding differently. In addition to improving local residents¡¯ site satisfaction, native perennial meadow plantings can produce biologically diverse grasslands that support richer and more abundant invertebrate communities, and restructured plant, invertebrate, and soil microbial communities compared with short mown grassland.

The current rapid growth of urban areas and concern over global pollinator declines have spurred numerous studies examining pollinator communities in temperate cities, but knowledge about tropical urban pollinators remains scarce.Methods: This study investigated the effects of habitat and landscape factors on pollinator richness and abundance in a highly-populated, tropical city: Bangkok, Thailand. We conducted pollinator observations in 52 green areas throughout the city and collected data on patch size, floral abundance, plant richness, location type, and percent vegetation at five spatial scales.Results: Of the 18,793 pollinators observed, over 98% were bees. Both patch size and floral abundance generally had positive effects on pollinators, although there was a significant interaction between the two factors; these findings were generally consistent across all focal taxa (Tetragonula stingless bees, Apis honey bees, Xylocopa carpenter bees, and butterflies).Discussion: Our results demonstrate the importance of maintaining large green areas in cities, since small green areas supported few pollinators, even when floral resources were abundant. Moreover, most pollinator taxa utilized a variety of location types (e.g., public parks, school campuses, temple grounds), with the exception of butterflies, which preferred parks. Our findings are generally consistent with those of temperate urban studies, but additional studies in the tropics are needed before global patterns can be assessed.Keywords: Bees; Fragmentation; Pollination; Southeast Asia; Urbanization.",NA,NA,PeerJ,6,7,e5335,NA,Article,J,NA,NA,snowballing_Brom2022,NA,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,Y,Xintong,No - excluded,NA,NA,other (please specify in next column),not flower planting,NA

The structural complexity of agricultural landscapes influences the local biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Hence, developing effective biodiversity management requires a better understanding of the relative importance of local and landscape changes, especially for functionally important organisms such as hover flies benefiting from flowering plants. 2. We examined hoverfly (Diptera: Syrphidae) communities in broad and narrow sown flower strips, in naturally developed grassy strips and in wheat fields (as a control). We also investigated the effects of these four habitat types on syrphid occurrence in the adjacent wheat fields. 3. The relative influence of local vs. landscape effects was tested by selecting study sites along a gradient of structural complexity from simple landscapes ([approximately]100% arable land) to complex landscapes (up to 70% semi-natural habitats such as fallows, field margins, hedges and grassland). Landscape complexity was assessed within landscape sectors of 0.5-4.0 km radius around strips. 4. Syrphid density and in particular, the density of aphidophagous species, was higher in narrow and broad sown flower strips compared to grassy strips and wheat-wheat boundary controls at the milk-ripening stage of the wheat. In addition, species richness of aphidophagous syrphids within wheat fields adjacent to broad sown flower strips was higher at the wheat peak-ripening stage. This indicates a spillover between habitats and a positive effect of these sown flower strips on potential biocontrol of cereal aphids. Flower densities and syrphid diversity and density, respectively, were closely related. 5. Species richness and abundance in the sown flower strips increased as the proportion of arable land in the surrounding landscape increased, suggesting that within structurally simple landscapes (at 0.5-1 km radius around the sites) syrphid flies concentrated on the most rewarding resources within the sown flower strips. Sown flower strips were more effective at increasing syrphid species richness and abundance in simple landscapes, presumably because the creation of flower resources made the greatest difference in such homogeneous, intensively managed arable landscapes. 6. Synthesis and applications. Agri-environment schemes should take the surrounding landscape characteristics into account when considering using sown flower strips to enhance syrphid density and diversity, and their biocontrol function, in arable landscapes. Creating locally such flower strips is more effective in simple landscapes containing a high proportion of arable land, while in complex landscapes, keeping the overall diversity is important.","Syrphidae [Species diversity /  / simple vs complex landscapes] and [Population density /  / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Sown flower strips and / ] [Germany / Lower Saxony, Goettingen / ].",HOVERFLY EPISYRPHUS-BALTEATUS; DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES; CEREAL APHID and CONTROL; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; NATURAL ENEMIES; and WINTER-WHEAT; PARASITOID INTERACTIONS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; FARMING SYSTEM,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,46,5,1106,1114,Article,J,University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,TRUE,1,NA,1,1,FALSE,Y,Xintong,Yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Effects of sown wildflower fields on the common hamster (<i>cricetus cricetus</i>) at local and landscape scales,10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.021,"During the last decades, agriculture has been rapidly intensified, resulting in a strong decline in species diversity. Therefore the common agricultural policy (CAP) of the EU implemented agri-environmental schemes (AES) for an environmentally-friendly management of agricultural areas. Sown wildflower fields are one of these measures aimed at enhancing insect diversity and related ecosystem services. However, little is known about the impacts of AES on rare and non-target species. To study the effect of these AES on a non-target species, the occurrence of the endangered common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) was mapped by counting reopened winter burrows on paired sown wildflower fields and agricultural fields in North-West Bavaria, Germany. Concentration effects in sown wildflower fields and the distribution of C cricetus in adjacent agricultural fields were studied by mapping burrows up to a distance of 200 m from sown wildflower and agricultural fields. Furthermore, C cricetus occurrence in relation to local (vegetation density, cover of grasses, vegetation height, size of wildflower fields) and landscape scale parameters (percentage of arable land, grassland, fallow land, distance to the nearest forest, and settlement) of sown wildflower fields was analysed. Results show that there was a concentration of C cricetus in sown wildflower fields, while densities in adjacent agricultural fields were constantly low. Hamster occurrence was negatively related to vegetation density and grass cover on sown wildflower fields and positively related to distance to the nearest forests, percentage of arable land and fallow land around wildflower fields. In conclusion, we could show that sown wildflower fields can be an ideal habitat for non-target species, such as the common hamster. However, local and landscape scale parameters of sown wildflower fields need to be considered when designing AES. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While their effectiveness in providing floral and other food resources for pollinators and natural enemies has been relatively well studied, much less is known about the value of different types of WFS as overwintering habitat for different functional arthropod groups. Here, we examined arthropod overwintering in WFS of different age compared to winter wheat fields. Moreover, we addressed the largely unexplored question to what extent non-permanent WFS may act as sink or ecological trap, if they attract high numbers of overwintering arthropods but only a low proportion of them survive and successfully emerge due to ploughing of strips during overwintering. Overwintering of all studied arthropod groups including potential pest natural enemies spiders, carabid beetles, staphylinid beetles and different families of pollinating flies was higher in WFS compared to winter wheat crops. Overwintering increased in WFS compared to wheat fields irrespective of WFS age, except for 4 year old WFS in the case of carabid beetles and 1 year old WFS in the case of spiders. While WFS age positively affected spider overwintering, numbers of overwintering pollinating flies and staphylinid beetles did not change significantly with WFS age. Moreover, carabid beetles tended to decline in the four years old WFS compared to younger ones. Ploughing of annual WFS during overwintering significantly reduced the number of successfully emerging arthropods by 59% on average. Detrimental effects were strongest for carabid beetles and spiders (reductions by 67% and 69%, respectively) to their numbers in ploughed WFS being similar to winter wheat fields. Reductions were less severe for pollinating flies and staphylinid beetles (both 47%), with higher numbers emerging from annual WFS compared to winter wheat fields even after ploughing of WFS. We conclude that perennial WFS are valuable overwintering habitats for a range of arthropod taxa across functional groups in arable cropping systems. Distinct responses of different arthropod taxa to WFS age highlight the importance of managing perennial WFS of various successional stages in order to promote overwintering of a broad variety arthropods in agro-ecosystems. Our study raises concerns, however, that annual WFS ploughed during the overwintering period are poor overwintering habitats for arthropods and may even act as ecological traps.",Agri-environment schemes; Biological control; Ecological trap; Emergence and trap; Flower strip; Insect hibernation,AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; BIOLOGICAL PEST-CONTROL; SEMINATURAL HABITATS; and BEE ABUNDANCE; ENHANCE; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; BEETLES; and ASSEMBLAGES,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,275,NA,123,131,Article,J,University of Bern; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,1,NA,1,3,FALSE,Y,Xintong,Yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The impact of wildflower strips on the nesting frequency of trap-nesting wasps or bees within localized areas has not been thoroughly investigated. Trap-nests made of bamboo reeds (Bambusa sp.) were placed adjacent to eight 0.1 ha wildflower plots and paired fallow areas (control plots) to determine if wildflower strips encourage the nesting of wasps and bees.

While benefits for flower-visiting and predatory insects during the vegetation period were frequently shown, few studies addressed the suitability of wildflower areas as overwintering habitats. Here, we studied the significance of wildflower areas as overwintering habitats and whether their benefits vary with landscape context, i.e. the proportions of permanent semi-natural habitats such as hedges. We selected ten landscapes that encompassed independent gradients of proportions of permanent semi-natural habitats (e.g. hedgerows, ditches) and transient wildflower areas. The centres of the landscapes were pairs of wildflower areas and arable fields on which we sampled overwintering ground-dwelling arthropods by emergence traps. In total, we recorded 2838 overwintering individuals from 115 species of rove and carabid beetles as well as spiders. Abundance of rove beetle larvae, as well as species richness of adult rove beetles and spiders was significantly higher in wildflower areas than in arable fields. With respect to landscape context, abundance and species richness of adult rove beetles showed a hump-shaped relationship with the proportion of permanent semi-natural habitats. The abundance of adult carabid beetles showed a hump-shaped relationship with the proportion of transient wildflower areas, while the abundance of carabid beetle larvae showed a hump-shaped pattern with permanent semi-natural habitats. For the first time we showed that, similar to the vegetation period, benefits of wildflower areas as overwintering habitats for ground-dwelling arthropods depend on both local habitat characteristics as well as landscape context. Benefits of wildflower areas for overwintering were highest in simple landscapes with an intermediate proportion of either permanent semi-natural habitats or transient wildflower areas. Our results suggest that in order to sustainably maintain the functional guild of ground-dwelling arthropods, agricultural landscapes should provide both sown wildflower areas and permanent semi-natural habitats.

Little knowledge exists, however, about the drivers of wild bee occurrence and if Red List species also profit from this agri-environmental scheme (AES). Therefore, we studied wild bees on transects along 20 four-to five-year-old WFS and in 10 cereal fields without AES (CONTROL sites) in differently structured landscapes across Saxony-Anhalt (Germany). In addition to local site parameters, we measured parameters of landscape structure in a 1 km radius of the WFS and CONTROL sites. The overall species richness of wild bees (125 species in total, 23 on average), including numerous specialist and Red List species, indicates a high attractiveness of perennial WFS sown with 30 native forbs. In CONTROL fields, 11 bee species (on average only one) were found. The species richness and abundance of wild bees were positively affected by local site conditions of the WFS and CONTROL sites, such as the overall number of sown and spontaneous forbs, the amount of flower rewards of sown forbs available to pollinators (Pollinator Feeding Index), and negatively by the cover of grasses. Therefore, seed mixtures of future AES should comprise a high diversity of wildflower species relevant as pollen sources for wild bees. The share of Red List wild bee species was strongly influenced by the landscape context and increased e.g. with Shannon landscape diversity and the availability of non-forest woody habitats and water bodies in the 1 km surroundings. These results suggest that besides the establishment of high-diversity WFS, semi-natural habitat structures have to be promoted to preserve rare wild bees especially in structurally simple agricultural landscapes.

We compared activity-density, species richness, ecological traits and assemblage composition of carabids among 20 winter wheat fields, 10 adjoining grassy field margins and 10 adjoining SWA. Beetle activity-density was higher in wheat fields compared with adjoining semi-natural habitats regarding total carabids, macropterous, polyphagous-carnivorous and euryoecious open habitat beetles. Although total species richness (analysis of variance) did not significantly differ among habitat types, we found significantly higher species numbers in SWA than in wheat fields adjoining SWA and grassy margins when the number of recorded species was standardized to the number of individuals (rarefaction).

Non-crop habitats in agroecosystems may counteract the loss of arthropods such as spiders and thus contribute to sustainable agriculture. However, the effectiveness of field margins and set-aside wildflower-sown patches in maintaining spider diversity is not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of three different non-crop habitats, namely field margins, set-aside wildflower-sown patches under power poles ('power pole islands'), and grassland fallows on spider diversity as compared to wheat fields in an agricultural landscape in western Germany. Using pitfall trapping and suction sampling, we show that species richness and overall conservation value were higher in non-crop habitats than in wheat fields. Interestingly, field margins and power pole islands differed from long-term grassland fallows only in conservation value, which was significantly higher in grassland fallows. Species assemblages differed considerably between grassland fallows, field margins and power pole islands, and wheat fields, documenting the added value of using different conservation strategies. Implications for insect conservation Small-scale non-crop habitats adjacent to wheat fields were surprisingly effective in promoting spider diversity in an agricultural landscape, with field margins and power pole islands being equally effective.

Since non-crop habitats are regarded as important refuges for farmland biodiversity, various greening measures have been proposed to halt biodiversity loss. However, the effectiveness of these measures for biodiversity conservation is still under debate. Therefore, we here compared ground-dwelling beetle (Coleoptera) assemblages of different non-crop habitats (field margins, set-aside fields sown with wildflowers, and permanent grassland fallows) and wheat fields within an intensively used agricultural landscape in western Germany. Taxonomic diversity of Carabidae, Staphylinidae and other coleopteran families and their conservation value were higher in all non-crop habitats than on wheat fields. Surprisingly, though, different types of non-crop habitats did not differ in species richness or the number of threatened species. Thus, field margins and sown wildflower fields were as effective in promoting beetle diversity as grassland fallows. However, different non-crop habitats supported different species assemblages, and several species, in particular especially large ones, were restricted to grassland fallows. These results suggest that different greening measures are effective in promoting the biodiversity of beetles, and that permanent grassland fallows are essential for nature conservation. The fact that habitat types harbored different assemblages stresses the need to combine a variety of greening measures to yield the highest benefit for biodiversity.","Carabidae; Coleoptera; Staphylinidae [Conservation measures / and Conservation value / ground-dwelling taxa] [Community structure / and Biodiversity / ] [Habitat preference /  / ] [Grassland / Grassland and fallows / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Agricultural landscapes / ] and [Germany / Eifel Mountain Range, Maifeld / ].",FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY; CARABID BEETLES; MANAGEMENT; STAPHYLINIDAE; and CONSERVATION; INTENSIFICATION; HETEROGENEITY; ASSEMBLAGES; POPULATIONS; and ARTHROPODS,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,30,13,3965,3981,Article,J,University of Koblenz & Landau,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,19,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this four-year field experiment, conducted on six field parcels, the ability of wildflower strips to simultaneously promote the availability of pollination services (using bumblebee abundance as a proxy), species diversity (total species richness of bumblebees, butterflies and diurnal moths) and conservation (abundance of habitat specialist butterflies) was evaluated. The results showed that the first two indicators increased strongly and rapidly in wildflower strips until the third year of the experiment. The conservation indicator increased more slowly and this response was related to the forest cover of the surrounding landscape. Furthermore, the benefits of wildflower strips were largely independent of experimentally varied strip properties. It is concluded that wildflower strips are a flexible mitigation tool to promote different biodiversity targets in agricultural systems.

Further, there is no consensus on shared benefits of existing conservation measures either. To unravel the causal factors behind the failure and success of conservation measures, we studied whether sown wildflower fields create sufficient ecological contrast and adequate foraging habitats for insectivorous bats and if potential benefits depend on landscape context. From June to September 2020, we simultaneously monitored insects and bats on paired wildflower and crop fields in landscapes with increasing complexity, here shares of semi-natural habitats such as hedgerows. We compared insect and specifically moth abundance as well as overall bat and foraging activity between wildflower and crop fields and studied effects of prey abundance on bat activity. During summer, insect and moth abundances were two- to fourfold higher on wildflower than crop fields. On wildflower fields, insect abundances increased with wildflower cover, while moth abundances increased with shares of semi-natural habitats. Bat activity on wildflower compared to crop fields was higher during the beginning and lower towards the end of summer. Both bat and foraging activity increased with insect abundance and decreased with patch size of wildflower fields. Wildflower fields seem to be a promising tool to provide adequate foraging habitats for insectivorous bats in agro-ecosystems but sufficient prey availability may be key, particularly during times of high food demand. Moreover, it seems vital to target complex landscapes and foster the retention and reintroduction of hedgerows in agro-ecosystems. ?? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Chiroptera [Conservation measures /  / predator prey relationships] and [Insect prey / Diptera / ] [ / Lepidoptera / ] [ / Neuroptera and (Neuroptera) / ] [Food availability / Prey availability / ] [Foraging / and Foraging habitat / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Sown wildflower fields / and ] [Germany / Schleswig-Holstein / ]. and Diptera; Lepidoptera; Neuroptera [Relative abundance /  / predator prey and relationships] [Mammalian predators / Chiroptera / ] [Cultivated land and habitat / Sown wildflower fields / ] [Germany / Schleswig-Holstein / ].,Hexapoda; abundance; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; bat; complexity; conservation planning; hedgerow; insectivory; land use change; moth; patch size; prey availability; reintroduction; vegetation cover,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,264,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,University of Kiel,Scopus,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,23,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bats are rarely studied in relation to AES effectiveness in contrast to birds, even though their presence and activity as biological control agents on insects, especially pest species, can be important for agricultural crops. While the role of hedgerows for bat occurrence and activity, as well as for their prey's diversity and abundance has been widely studied, the role of other AESs such as flower fields remains unclear. We monitored the activity of the main functional groups (edge, narrow and open space foragers) using ultrasound recorders, as well as potential prey abundances using light traps, across 35 study sites representing different AES in Central Germany from late July to September 2018. The sampled AES consisted of annual flower fields, mixed flower fields (with annual and biennial vegetation), perennial flower fields (sown every 5 years), hedgerows (surrounded by meadows and agricultural fields), and were compared to winter wheat (control) in a balanced design. Bat activity over hedgerows increased threefold for edge space foragers and sevenfold for narrow space foragers compared to wheat fields. Compared to wheat fields, narrow space forager activity increased fourfold over perennial flower fields, threefold over annual and twofold over mixed flower fields. This group's activity over hedgerows also increased almost threefold compared to mixed flower fields. However, the number of feeding buzzes and prey abundance did not differ significantly between AES. We detected foraging group-specific differences in bat activity between the studied AES. Thus, to promote bats in agricultural landscapes and to ensure their biological control services, it is important to establish more AES, such as hedgerows and flower fields, to increase their diversity and connectivity in intensively used agricultural landscapes.

Butterflies were recorded along transects during one season in twenty-five sown wildflower strips and eleven extensively used meadows in a Swiss lowland agricultural landscape (600 ha). In total 1,669 butterflies of 25 species were observed (25 in the strips, 18 in meadows). This can be related to 38 species recorded in the region (lowland part of Kanton Fribourg) within the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring Programme. In wildflower strips the number of butterflies per transect meter was significantly higher than in the meadows, but there was no significant difference in species richness. Butterfly communities, though, were quite different between the two habitat types. Habitat type, abundances of flowering plants and presence of forest within 50 m were identified as factors influencing butterfly species richness. Butterfly abundances were affected by habitat type and abundance of flowering plants. In wildflower strips, 65% of all flower visits by butterflies were observed on Origanum. It can be concluded that sown wildflower strips can support a substantial part of a regions species pool.

Three hypotheses were tested: (1) butterfly diversity and abundance are higher in WFS than in conventional fields; (2) butterfly diversity and abundance are enhanced by the amount, proximity and connectivity of WFS in the landscape context; (3) additional factors influence butterfly diversity and abundance according to individual site conditions and landscape context characteristics linked to other landscape elements. WFS had more species and individuals of butterflies than conventional habitats. However, promoted species were mainly generalists; few specialists were enhanced. The diversity of all butterflies and of generalists increased linearly with percent cover of WFS, reflecting an effect of restoration measures depending on the landscape context.

Farmers in Lower Saxony, Germany, may receive payments for three flower field types: annual, perennial (five years old), and mixed flower fields composed of yearly alternating annual and biannual parts. We assessed the effectiveness of these flower field types in providing bumblebee foraging habitat compared to control cereal fields. We sampled bumblebees with transect walks and assessed the richness of exploited pollen plants using DNA meta-barcoding and direct observations. All flower field types enhanced bumblebee abundance and species richness compared to control fields but attracted mostly three generalist species. Although we expected highest benefits from the more heterogeneous mixed flower fields, abundance was highest in annual, only intermediate in mixed, and lowest in perennial flower fields. Bumblebee species richness did not differ between flower field types. Overall, the proportion of sown plants in pollen loads was surprisingly low (< 50%). Bombus pascuorum, but not B. terrestris agg., exploited 10% of the sown plant species in perennial, 36% in annual and 45% in mixed flower fields, respectively. Compared to direct observations, pollen samples revealed 4.5 times more visited plant species and thus assessed floral resource use more reliably. Plant species richness in pollen loads decreased with local flowering plant species richness and increased with proportion of annual crops in the landscape, potentially due to the exploitation of more diverse and scattered resources, including flowering crops, in homogenized landscapes to fulfil dietary requirements. Our results indicate that under the current management, both annual and mixed flower fields provide the most attractive food resources, while perennial flower fields offered the poorest foraging habitats. Conclusively, flower fields seem important but resources from the surrounding landscape are still needed to sustain bumblebees in agricultural landscapes.

Yet, its impact on the reproductive success and population dynamics of wild bees, and how adverse effects can be mitigated, remains poorly understood. We established populations of seven solitary bee species varying in body size in experimentally sown wildflower strips (WFS), existing semi-natural habitats (SNH; forest edges) and isolated sites lacking WFS and SNH in the local surrounding (350 m radius) to test (a) whether the wild bee species use planted flowers of WFS to provision offspring with pollen, (b) whether vicinity to WFS reduces their foraging trip duration, (c) parasitism rate and (d) whether it increases bee reproductive success of nesting populations. Furthermore, we tested whether the effect size depends on the body size of the bee species considered. We show that wild bees nesting in WFS provisioned their offspring primarily with pollen from plants of WFS. This led to shorter foraging trips of all bee species nesting in WFS compared to bees nesting in isolated (unrestored) sites and overall increased reproductive success (i.e. more viable offspring). Reproductive success of bees nesting in WFS was also higher, and parasitism rates lower, compared to bees nesting at forest edges. Smaller-potentially less mobile-bee species benefitted more than larger ones from WFS plantings in terms of reproductive success. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that diverse WFS can enhance the reproductive success of multiple solitary wild bee species, thereby mitigating negative impacts of agroecosystem simplification through the provision of suitable floral resources and reduced foraging times required for offspring provisioning.

A total of 42 fields were investigated, half with at least 3-year-old margin strips created under the UK agri-environment scheme Countryside Stewardship and half nearby control sites. The sites were grouped on the basis of average field size into small, intermediate or open landscape locations to examine landscape structure effects. Assessments of the flora, bird and territory numbers, bees, spiders, Orthoptera and Carabidae were made in early to mid-summer 2003. There were positive impacts on diversity or abundance for the flora, bees and Orthoptera. The herbaceous flora of the pre-existing boundary adjacent to sown 6 m strips was significantly more species-rich than controls, probably reflecting a buffer effect of the strip. Bees and Orthoptera, the latter of which were only found in field boundaries, were more abundant where strips were sited, reflecting added habitat resources. Bee numbers were significantly lower in field centres where there were no 6 m margin strips. There were no significant effects of sown strips on numbers of birds observed or bird territories, spiders or Carabidae, but also no negative impacts. Lycosid spiders were consistently more abundant in boundaries of small fields with 6 m margin strips. Linyphiidae were more abundant within the crop area of smaller fields. Amongst birds, wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes) were also more abundant in small fields, while yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella) were more abundant in open landscapes. The results confirm there are benefits to farmland biodiversity from introducing new margin strips at the edges of arable fields. More significantly, the success of agri-environment schemes, which will vary between taxa and species, can be dependent on landscape structure.

Their beneficial effects on natural enemies of pest insects are well documented but (1) the desired spill-over into crop fields has not always been demonstrated, and (2) the need to adapt sown mixtures to regional climatic differences has been rarely addressed. We set up a multi-site experiment in different French climatic regions to compare effects of a wildflower strip with a grass mixture and spontaneous vegetation. The design included five regions, three to five fields per region and the three strip treatments being repeated in each field. We tested strip treatment effects on vegetation (plant species richness, plant and flower cover) and on natural enemies (hoverflies, ladybirds, aphid predation). In a subset, we further analysed the spill-over into winter wheat fields including natural enemies and pest insects (cereal aphids, leaf beetles). The wildflower strip mixture developed well in all regions and increased plant species richness and flower cover compared with grass strips and spontaneous vegetation. We found a corresponding higher hoverfly abundance and aphid predation in wildflower strips that were consistent in all regions, whereas ladybird abundance was not affected. A significantly higher hoverfly abundance, aphid predation and aphid parasitism in wheat fields close to wildflower strips indicated a spill-over. No corresponding margin treatment effects were observed for aphid and leaf beetle abundance in the field. A multivariate analysis comparing the influence of climate and vegetation parameters showed that floral cover better explained variation in natural enemy abundance and predation than climate. Our results demonstrated that similar mixtures of native plants can be used over large climatic gradients to improve biocontrol. Further research is needed to improve spill-over into crop fields and to obtain consistently strong effects in different climate zones. (C) 2022 The Authors.

In many countries, agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced to counteract this current trend. However, until now, the relative importance of each AES for biodiversity and ecosystem services is still little understood and might change depending on landscape context. Complex landscape-experiments are required to fill this knowledge gap, enabling the implementation of sustainable intensification of food production. In our study, we compared the effectiveness of the two most popular AES in Germany, organic farming and flower strips, in supporting pollinators and flower resources. We selected nine landscapes along a gradient of increasing field size, (configurational heterogeneity), each with a triplet of winter wheat fields: one organic, one conventional with flower strip and one conventional without flower strip as a control. We surveyed insect-pollinated plants and pollinators (bumblebees, solitary bees and hoverflies). Additionally, we placed bumblebee colonies in the field edges to monitor their growth (colony weight gain) and reproduction (queen production). Flower strips stood out with the highest abundance and richness of pollinators. In contrast, bumblebee colony growth and plant richness benefited equally from organic and flower strip schemes. At the landscape scale, smaller fields had a positive effect on plant richness and bumblebee reproduction in flower strips. By contrast, bumblebee colonies in organic agriculture benefited most from large fields, as large organic fields provided much more flower resources than the narrow flower strips. Synthesis and applications. Our results showed that both local and landscape management shaped pollinator communities and their reproduction. Overall, organic farming and flower strips appeared to be effective tools to mitigate flower shortage in conventional cereal fields, with organic farming supporting the highest flowering plant cover per field. Flower strips enhanced local pollinator richness most, but increased bumblebee reproduction only when the surrounding landscapes had small fields with long field borders. Therefore, our results reveal that European Union policies need to take into account that the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes depends on the structure of the surrounding landscape.",configurational heterogeneity; edge effect; field size; flower strip; and hoverfly; landscape structure; organic farming; solitary bee,BEE COLONY GROWTH; LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION; SPECIES RICHNESS; and NEONICOTINOID PESTICIDE; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; HOMING ABILITY; HABITAT and AREA; LAND-USE; DIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,57,9,1818,1828,Article,J,University of Gottingen; University of Padua; University of Gottingen; and University of Bonn; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the and Czech Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian and Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Ecological Research,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,32,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the European Union, agri-environment schemes (AESs) have been developed to mitigate these challenges. There are two opposing AES strategies, targeting either production or non-production areas. Organic farming focuses on production and conservation on the same land-use area, whereas flower strips adjacent to crop fields are in favour of intensified conventional production combined with conservation strips outside the cultivated area. We investigated pest and natural enemy abundances of organic farming versus establishing flower strip in 10 agricultural landscapes in Central Germany along a gradient of mean field size (1.24-6.78 ha). We focused on three winter wheat fields per landscape: conventional field (control), conventional field with adjacent flower strip and organic field. We sampled crop pests such as cereal leaf beetles (CLBs) and cereal aphids as well as their natural enemies. Our results indicated that the abundance of CLB larvae was more than two times higher in conventional farming with and without flower strip than that in the organic farming. The abundance of natural enemies was supported by landscapes with small mean field size, that is their numbers increased c. threefold when field size decreased from 7 to 2 ha. Aphid abundance was lower in organic fields and conventional control fields than in conventional fields with flower strips suggesting a potential disservice of flower strips. Parasitoids and natural enemies benefited from flower strips, but they were obviously not able to control the aphids. Synthesis and applications. The major pests in cereals, aphids and CLBs infested organic farming less than flower strips along conventional fields. However, the abundance of natural enemies of pests benefited from flower strips and, in addition, from decreasing field size in agricultural landscapes. Hence, enhancing predator populations for more effective biological pest control may be best with decreasing field sizes combined with organic farming and flower strips.

Here, we show how spatial scale, i.e. studied transect, field or farm level, and controlling for yield loss, can drastically change the evaluation of biodiversity benefits of on-field (organic farming) vs. off-field (flower strips) schemes. We selected ten agricultural landscapes in Central Germany, each with a triplet of winter wheat fields: one organic, one conventional with flower strip, and one conventional without flower strip as a control. We surveyed the abundance of wild bees at field edges for two years. We found that comparing data at the transect level may lead to misleading conclusions, because flower strips, covering only 5% of conventional fields, support fewer bees than large organic fields. However, a 50% cereal yield loss of organic farming can be considered as equivalent to yield levels of 50 ha conventional plus 50 ha flower strip. This would promote 3.5-times more bees than 100 ha organic farming. In conclusion, considering various scales in the evaluation of agri-environment scheme measures is necessary to reach a balanced understanding of their ecological and economic effects and their effectiveness.

However, it remains largely unexplored how various factors (design, habitat quality, landscape context) interact to determine the occurrence of butterflies in flower strips. Therefore, butterflies were surveyed in 15 flower strips differing in age (first and second growing season). Flower strips were compared with 15 field margins, which were adjacent to arable land and were dominated by grasses. The field studies were conducted during two summers (2013, 2014) in Lower Saxony (Germany). Additionally, based on a literature study, 17 environmental variables likely to be decisive for the occurrence of butterflies were identified and recorded during these field studies or analyzed in GIS. Supported by a PCA, 8 environmental variables for flower strips and 7 for field margins, were selected and included in linear mixed-effects models in order to calculate their effect on butterflies. We documented 19 butterfly species and 1,394 individuals in the flower strips and 13 species and 401 individuals in the field margins. The number of flowering plant species was the key factor for the occurrence of butterflies - both in flower strips and field margins. The diversity of the surrounding landscape (Shannon-Index H) had an additional significant influence on butterflies in flower strips, with more species and individuals being observed on areas with a lower Shannon-Index. Number of flowering plant species is the key driver of butterfly diversity and abundance, which improves the habitat quality of flower strips in agricultural landscapes. In order to promote butterflies optimally, flower strips must have a good supply of flowers even over several years. This requires careful design and management, as flower supply often decreases with increasing age of the flower strips. The study indicates that flower strips have a particularly high effect in structurally simple landscapes.","Papilionoidea [Species diversity /  / flower strips vs field margins] and [Population density /  / ] [Habitat preference /  / ] [Cultivated land and habitat / Agricultural landscape / ] [Germany / Lower Saxony, Rotenburg and district, Zeven / ].",AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; SOWN WILDFLOWER STRIPS; SPECIES RICHNESS; and ENHANCE BIODIVERSITY; GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT; BRITISH BUTTERFLIES; DIURNAL and MOTHS; ROAD VERGES; FALLOW TYPE; DIVERSITY,HELIYON,5,5,NA,NA,Article,J,Leibniz University Hannover; Leibniz University Hannover,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,37,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased. The effectiveness of this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony establishment and growth in spring.

More specifically, developing farming practices which enhance biological pest control is a main issue for today's agriculture. The aim of this study was to assess whether the two strategies of complicating the search of host plants by pests by increasing plant diversity, and of supporting their natural enemies by managing habitats, could be combined simultaneously at the field scale to restore biological pest control and reduce chemical insecticide use. In Gembloux (Belgium), wildflower strips (WFS) were sown within wheat crops in which pests (i.e., aphids), their predators (i.e. aphidophagous hoverflies, lacewings and ladybeetles) and parasitoid wasps were monitored for 10 weeks in the period of May through July 2015 as indicators of the ES of pest control. Aphids were significantly reduced and adult hoverflies favoured in wheat in between WFS, compared to monoculture wheat plots. No significant differences were observed for adult lacewings, ladybeetles and parasitoids. In all treatments, very few lacewing and ladybeetle larvae were observed on wheat tillers. The abundance of hoverfly larvae was positively correlated with the aphid density on tillers in between WFS, showing that increasing food provisions by multiplying habitats within fields, and not only along margins, can help supporting aphidophagous hoverflies in crops. By enhancing the ecosystem services of biological pest control, this study shows that increasing both plant diversity and managing habitats for natural enemies may reduce aphid populations, hence insecticide use. Future research should continue this vein of work by quantifying the link between agricultural practices and the delivery of ecosystem services in order to guide future measures of agricultural policies.

The explicit and implicit aims of creating ecological focus areas (EFAs) and implementing greening measures in European agro-ecosystems include the promotion of regulatory ecosystem services (ES) to sustain crop production in conventional cropping systems. However, the extent to which these goals are achieved with current policy measures remains poorly explored. 2. We measured insect-mediated pollination and natural pest control service provisioning in 18 winter oilseed rape fields as a function of the independent and interactive effects of local EFA establishment-sown wildflower strips and hedgerows-and landscape-scale greening measures within a 1 km radius around focal fields and quantified their contribution to crop yield. 3. Insect pollination potential and pest predation increased on average by 10% and 13%, respectively, when landscape-scale greening measures share was increased from 6% to 26%. For pollination, the increase was stronger in fields adjoining an EFA (14%) than in fields without adjacent EFA (7%). 4. Agricultural management practices were the main drivers of crop yield. Neither insect pollination potential or natural pest control (pest predation and parasitism) nor adjacent EFAs and landscape-scale greening significantly affected crop yield in addition to agricultural management. 5. Synthesis and applications. Local establishment of perennial, species-rich wildflower strips and hedgerows, combined with landscape-scale greening measures in agricultural landscapes, can promote multiple ecosystem services (ES) in conventional production systems. Benefits may be maximized when local and landscape measures are combined. However, enhanced pollination and natural pest regulation seem to contribute relatively little to final crop yield compared to local agricultural management practices in the high-input conventional production system studied. Further research is needed to better understand how to improve the effectiveness of ecological focus areas and other greening measures in promoting regulatory ES.

We tested the performance of experimentally sown annual flower strips specifically designed to promote natural enemies of aphids and their pest control services (tailored flower strips) in adjacent potato crops (n=8) compared with control fields (n=10). Flower strips consisted of 11 plant species providing abundant floral and extra-floral resources. The abundance of key natural enemies of aphids (hoverflies, lacewings and ladybirds) and hoverfly species richness was greatly enhanced in tailored flower strips compared with potato control strips. This resulted in an average increase in the number of eggs deposited by hoverflies and lacewings by 127% and 48%, respectively, and a reduction in the number of aphids by 75% in adjacent potato crops.Synthesis and applications. We conclude that tailored flower strips can be an effective agri-environmental measure to enhance natural enemies and aphid control in nearby crops. Indeed, tailored flower strips may help to reduce insecticide input in potato production as they significantly decrease the probability that action thresholds are reached. Promoting natural enemy abundance and diversity, as observed for hoverflies, may increase the stability of pest control and provide additional benefits to agro-ecosystems in terms of natural enemy conservation.

One potential method of mitigating these effects is creating flower strips. Most previous studies have shown higher pollinator abundances in flower strips, but none have been able to demonstrate increased pollinator abundances at larger spatial scales, in the surrounding agricultural landscapes. We assessed local and landscape-wide effects of flower strips on pollinator abundances, using 18 carefully selected study landscapes in southern Sweden, distributed along independent gradients of landscape heterogeneity and farming intensity. We found that flower strips were more attractive than field borders in general to bumblebees, whereas hoverflies were only attracted to flower strips from nearby field borders. Solitary bees declined with increasing distance from flower strips, but only in complex landscapes. As one of the first studies investigating effects of flower strips on pollinators across the wider landscape, we found increased abundance of bumblebees, but not solitary bees, in field borders outside the flower strips in floristically enhanced landscapes as compared with control landscapes. However, we found that higher quality and/or larger total area of flower strips within a farm was important for both bumblebees and solitary bees. Hoverfly abundance was enhanced on farms with flower strips in simple landscapes. Our results demonstrate that flower strips with rewarding plants do not only attract pollinators locally, but in addition have the potential to increase pollinator abundances across entire landscapes, and particularly in landscapes dominated by farmland.

The action formed part of a multidisciplinary initiative promoted by the Barilla food company, aimed at promoting the sustainable production of soft wheat. Specific aims were to study the effects of flowering areas on (i) the abundance and species richness of insect pollinators, including wild bees, syrphids and butterflies; (ii) the levels of wheat aphid and bug infestations and (iii) the assemblages of biological control agents of aphids (coccinellids and aphid mummies as a result of parasitization). Insect surveys were carried out on 61 wheat-growing farms located in Northern Italy. Insect pollinators were sampled on all farms, whereas wheat aphids, wheat bugs and aphid biological control agents were investigated in a sub-sample of 20 farms. Results generally indicated a positive impact of flowering areas on multiple taxa in comparison with spontaneous field margins. The abundance of pollinators and coccinellids was significantly enhanced by the flowering areas. Aphid mummies showed an interaction between strategies and distances with more mummies at 5 m in wheat plots close to flowering areas and at 50 m in the plots close to spontaneous field margin (control). Flowering areas were validated as an important tool for promoting beneficial taxa in agro-ecosystems. However, the successful establishment of this ecological infrastructure was suggested to rely on several factors, which included both the selection of suitable flowering plant species and the implementation of appropriate management practices.

Pollination services from wild insects contribute to crop productivity around the world, but are at risk of decline in agricultural landscapes. Using highbush blueberry as a model system, we tested whether wildflower plantings established adjacent to crop fields would increase the abundance of wild pollinators during crop bloom and enhance pollination and yield. 2. Plantings were seeded in 2009 with a mix of 15 perennial wildflower species that provided season-long bloom and increased plant density and floral area during the subsequent 3 years. 3. Honeybees visiting blueberry flowers had similar abundance in enhanced and control fields in all 4 years of this study, whereas wild bee and syrphid abundance increased annually in the fields adjacent to wildflower plantings. 4. Crop pollination parameters including percentage fruit set, berry weight and mature seeds per berry were significantly greater in fields adjacent to wildflower plantings 3 and 4 years after seeding, leading to higher crop yields and with the associated revenue exceeding the cost of wildflower establishment and maintenance. 5. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that provision of forage habitat for bees adjacent to pollinator-dependent crops can conserve wild pollinators in otherwise resource-poor agricultural landscapes. Over time, these plantings can support higher crop yields and bring a return on the initial investment in wildflower seed and planting establishment, also insuring against loss of managed pollinators.

We found that floral margins significantly benefit the natural enemy community and biological control services, relative to non-floral grass margins. We confirm that field margin type is linked to higher abundance and diversity of natural enemies, lower numbers of herbivorous invertebrate pests, and reduced crop damage. We consider whether specific characterisations of natural enemies and pest communities vary between these margin types, finding key differences in the abundances of aerial and epigeal enemies, the diversity of parasitoid and predatory enemies and pest abundances found in naturally regenerating and sown floral field margins.

Conservation measures that are easy to implement and accepted by farmers are needed to halt a further loss of pollinators in large areas under intensive agricultural management. Here we report the results of a replicated long-term study involving networks of mostly perennial flower strips covering 10% of a conventionally managed agricultural landscape in southwestern Germany. Results: We demonstrate the considerable success of these measures for wild bee and butterfly species richness over an observation period of 5 years. Overall species richness of bees and butterflies but also the numbers of specialist bee species clearly increased in the ecological enhancement areas as compared to the control areas without ecological enhancement measures. A three to five-fold increase in species richness was found after more than 2 years of enhancement of the areas with flower strips. Oligolectic bee species increased significantly only after the third year. Conclusions: In our long-term field experiment we used a large variety of seed mixtures and temporal variation in seeding time, ensured continuity of the flower-strips by using perennial seed mixtures and distributed the measures over c. 10% of the landscape. This led to an increase in pollinator abundance, suggesting that these measures may be instrumental for the successful support of pollinators. These measures may ensure the availability of a network of diverse habitats and foraging resources for pollinators throughout the year, as well as nesting sites for many species. The measures are applied in-field and are suitable for application in areas under intensive agriculture. We propose that flower strip networks should be implemented much more in the upcoming CAP (common agricultural policy) reform in the European Union and promoted more by advisory services for farmers.","Apoidea; Papilionoidea [Farming and agriculture / Flower strip networks and / ] [Food plants /  / ] [Pollination /  / ] [Species diversity / Species and richnes / ] [Population dynamics / Abundance / ] [Cultivated land and habitat / Cultivated agricultural areas / ] [Spatial environment / and Habitat fragmentation / ] [Germany / Baden-Wuerttemberg, Dettenheim & and Rheinmuenster / ].",AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; LAND-USE; WILDFLOWER STRIPS; WILD BEES; and BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY; PLANT DIVERSITY; and INTENSIFICATION; LANDSCAPES; IMPACTS,BMC ECOLOGY,18,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,University of Koblenz & Landau; Bayer AG,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,TRUE,0,NA,1,48,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The promotion of natural enemies by increasing resource availability through flower strips is a promising approach for integrated pest management. In a 3-year field study, two annual and two perennial flower strip mixtures, as well as a grass mixture, were tested regarding their attractiveness for natural enemies at three different study sites in Germany. Natural enemies were sampled annually in nine sampling rounds at a 10-day rhythm using sweep netting and pitfall traps. To assess available floral resources, we estimated the species-specific flower cover and classified species into flower types. Flower strip mixtures differed in their attractiveness to natural enemies. Treatment effects on arthropod activity density were most pronounced in the second and third year. Overall, perennial were more attractive than annual flower strip mixtures for most natural enemies, however, the response to flower strip mixtures varied significantly among taxa. For example, perennial flower strips showed a two- to fourfold increase of plant-dwelling spider and parasitoid wasp activity density as well as higher numbers of juvenile stages of predatory bugs and rove beetles compared to annual flower strips. In contrast, annual flower strip mixtures showed the highest attractiveness for ground beetles. Moreover, different natural enemy taxa were associated with varying flower strip characteristics such as flower type proportion, herbivore availability and plant species richness. Synthesis and applications. We found taxon-specific responses of natural enemies to different flower strips, which provide guidance for the floral composition of flower strips in order to maximize their effectiveness for natural pest control. We suggest the use of perennial mixtures with high proportion of flower heads (Asteraceae) and disk flowers (esp. Apiaceae, Rubiaceae, Brassicaceae) in particular, but also flag blossoms (Fabaceae) as these flower types were positively associated with several natural enemy groups.

Treatments included mixes that specifically targeted: (1) pollinators ('concealed-nectar plants'); (2) natural enemies ('open-nectar plants'); or (3) both groups concurrently (i.e., 'multi-functional' mix). Flower strips were established in alleyways of four orchards and compared to control alleyways (no flowers). Pollinator (e.g., bees) and natural enemy (e.g., parasitoid wasps, predatory flies and beetles) visitation to flower strips, alongside measures of pest control (aphid colony densities, sentinel prey predation), and fruit production, were monitored in orchards over two consecutive growing seasons. Targeted flower strips attracted either pollinators or natural enemies, whereas mixed flower strips attracted both groups in similar abundance to targeted mixes. Natural enemy densities on apple trees were higher in plots containing open-nectar plants compared to other treatments, but effects were stronger for non-aphidophagous taxa. Predation of sentinel prey was enhanced in all flowering plots compared to controls but pest aphid densities and fruit yield were unaffected by flower strips.

We used orchard edges without any enhancement as control. The study took place over three consecutive years in Southern Germany. Wild bee abundance and species richness were highest in flower strips followed by improved hedges. Hoverflies were also most abundant in flower strips, but not more species rich than at control sites. Wild bee but not hoverfly community composition differed between control and enhancement sites.

To maximize the effect of flower strips given limited resources, we need spatially explicit tools that can prioritize their placement, and for identifying plant species to include in seed mixtures.We sampled bees and plant species as well as their interactions in a semi-controlled field experiment with roadside/field edge pairs with/without a sown flower strip at 31 sites in Norway and used a regional spatial model of solitary bee species richness to test if the effect of flower strips on bee species richness was predictable from the modelled solitary bee species richness.We found that sites with flower strips were more bee species rich compared to sites without flower strips and that this effect was greatest in areas that the regional solitary bee species richness model had identified to be particularly important for bees. Spatial models revealed that even within small landscapes there were pronounced differences between field edges in the predicted effect of sowing flower strips.Of the plant species that attracted the most bee species, the majority mainly attracted bumblebees and only few species also attracted solitary bees. Considering both the taxonomic diversity of bees and the species richness of bees attracted by plants we suggest that seed mixes containing Hieracium spp. such as Hieracium umbellatum, Pilosella officinarum, Taraxacum spp., Trifolium repens, Lotus corniculatus, Stellaria graminea and Achillea millefolium would provide resources for diverse bee communities in our region.Spatial prediction models of bee diversity can be used to identify locations where flower strips are likely to have the largest effect and can thereby provide managers with an important tool for prioritizing how funding for agri-environmental schemes such as flower strips should be allocated. Such flower strips should contain plant species that are attractive to both solitary and bumblebees, and do not need to be particularly plant species rich as long as the selected plants complement each other. Sowing flower strips along field edges is a widely adopted method for conserving pollinating insects in agricultural landscapes. We sampled bees and plant species as well as their interactions in a semi-controlled field experiment with roadside/field edge pairs with/without a sown flower strip at 31 sites in Norway (A-C).

Natural enemies can deliver protection against pests but compared to the surrounding non-crop habitat their abundance is usually low in intensively managed agricultural systems. Wildflower interventions established for Conservation Biological Control as part of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) can reinstate habitat for natural enemies within cropped areas and enhance natural pest control. Over a three-year period, this more sustainable approach to crop protection was investigated in eight sweet cherry orchards protected under polytunnels in the West Midlands (UK). Wildflower strips were established in alleyways between rows of cherry trees and managed under two cutting regimes, Standard Wildflower Strips (SWS) (a single cut in late September) and Actively Managed Wildflower Strips (AMWS) (regularly cut to a height of 20 cm throughout the growing season). These were compared to unsown Control Strips (CS) (original vegetation dominated by grass species). To investigate natural enemy populations and pest regulation services, direct search, Vortis suction sampling, beat sampling, and aphid bait cards were used. Araneae (40.0% of records) and parasitoid wasps (22.7%) were the most frequent natural enemies recorded in alleyways, whilst Anystidae (51.8%) and Araneae (20.8%) were most abundant on cherry trees. Wildflower treatments almost doubled the abundance of natural enemies in alleyways, and increased abundance in cherry trees by [approximately]15% compared to the CS. Wildflower strips increased predation of aphids (bait cards) in cherry trees by 25%. No difference in natural enemy abundance, richness or pest control was recorded between the two wildflower management regimes. Differences in natural enemy abundance and predation rates were detected despite the continued use of pesticides by growers (an average of 5.4 ([plus or minus] 0.4) applications per orchard per year). This study demonstrates that creating wildflower habitat in commercial sweet cherry orchards under polytunnels can boost natural enemies and the associated pest regulation services. Relative to CS, the novel grower-friendly approach of maintaining wildflower strips at a height of 20 cm with regular cutting increased flower resource availability and pest regulation services, demonstrating the potential for growers to adopt this approach as part of a robust IPM strategy.",Aculeata [Biological control /  / ] [Dipteran hosts / Drosophila suzukii and / ] [Hemipteran hosts / Acyrthosiphon pisum / ] [ / Myzus cerasi / ] [ / and Aphidoidea / ] [Community structure /  / ]. and Acyrthosiphon pisum; Aphidoidea; Drosophila suzukii; Myzus cerasi and [Biological control /  / Arthropod predators] [ /  / ] [Hymenopteran and parasites / Aculeata / ] [Plant hosts / Prunus avium / Biocontrol by and natural enemies] [Predators / Arthropoda / ]. and Arthropoda [Biological control /  / ] [Insect prey / Acyrthosiphon pisum and (Hemiptera) / ] [ / Drosophila suzukii (Diptera) / ] [ / Myzus cerasi and (Hemiptera) / ] [ / Aphidoidea (Hemiptera) / ] [Community structure /  / and ].,CENTRAL-EUROPE; PESTICIDES; BIOCONTROL; NORTHERN; HABITAT; APPLES; PEARS,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,317,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,University of Worcester; University of Reading,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,56,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it is unclear where and to what degree these flower plantings are effective. Recent studies suggest that flower plantings may be less effective if they are established in landscapes with either very low or very high amounts of non-crop habitat. Moreover, while field edge flower plantings often increase the abundance and richness of bees in field edges, it is unclear whether this improves crop pollination or bee nesting success, which could increase bee populations over time. In this study we examined how field edge flower plantings and the landscape context in which they are established affect wild bee conservation and crop pollination. Across two years we established flower plantings of 0.1??¨¬0.5 ha along the edges of 17 of 34 commercial cucumber fields arranged across a gradient of landscape complexity. We then measured wild bee abundance, richness, and crop pollination in and around cucumber fields with and without plantings and assessed the nesting success of stem-nesting bees. We found that both field edge flowers and landscape-scale non-crop habitat had independent, positive effects on bee abundance, richness, nesting, or crop pollination in one of the two years of the study, and that the effects of field edge flowers on bees and crop pollination were not influenced by the surrounding landscape. We also found that managing field edges in a way that maintains naturally-occurring flowers may matter as much or more than flower plantings for short-term increases in bee abundance and richness. However, certain species of planted flowers might be associated with improved bee nesting success, an outcome important for both bee conservation and sustained crop pollination. ?? 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Apis mellifera [Conservation measures /  / ] [Food plants /  / ] and [Reproductive productivity / Nesting success / ] [Pollination /  / ] and [Population size / Population abundance / ] [Cultivated land habitat / and Field edge flower plantings / ] [Wisconsin /  / ].,MEGACHILE-ROTUNDATA HYMENOPTERA; AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; OFFSPRING and PRODUCTION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; BIODIVERSITY; HABITATS; PREFERENCE; and FARMLAND; BENEFITS,"AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT",362,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,Scopus,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,58,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pest regulation services, harnessed through the conservation of natural enemies in the agri-environment are an economically important service degraded by conventional citrus production practices. For the first time, a sown wildflower strip composed of native forbs and tussock-forming grasses has been investigated for its influence on natural enemies and their pest regulation services in citrus orchards. A novel management strategy was applied, using the predicted generation times of Aonidiella aurantii Maskell (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), a key pest in citrus, to determine whether cutting the wildflower strips could force spill-over of natural enemies onto the adjacent crop, enhancing pest regulation services. Three treatments applied to orange orchard alleyways were compared: i) a control treatment, the standard orchard practice of regular cutting to 5 cm throughout the year, ii) a sown wildflower treatment managed with cutting once a year in February to a height of 10 cm (standard management wildflower treatment, SMWT), and iii) the same sown wildflower treatment but managed with two additional cuts in May and June (active management wildflower treatment, AMWT). Orange tree canopies were sampled for natural enemies, and pest regulation services were quantified using sentinel prey cards baited with Ephestia kuehniella eggs. Natural enemy richness was greatest in canopies with SMWT, supporting a greater relative abundance of primary parasitoids and lower relative abundances of antagonists (ants) compared to the control. This was associated with enhanced pest regulation services (depletion of sentinel prey from baited cards), especially during the early summer months, which coincides with a critical period to control A. aurantii and other key citrus pests. In contrast, AMWT did not enhance natural enemy richness, and pest regulation services were diminished. This study suggests that leaving wildflower strips uncut throughout the season, as in SMWT, may help to mitigate pest incidence through enhanced pest regulation services.

Apple is Europe's most frequently produced orchard fruit, requiring high pesticide input to combat the most important apple insect pests, Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini) and Cydia pomonella (L.). Here we sought to control these pests by promoting natural enemies using sown perennial flower strips. We trialled these in the alleyways of organic apple orchards in seven European countries. Visual assessments over two years revealed a higher number of natural enemies on plant parts, and specifically in D. plantaginea colonies on trees, in flower strip plots than on trees in control plots with standard orchard vegetation. Trees in the flower strip plots recorded a slower D. plantaginea population increase as compared with control plots, resulting in reduced fruit damage after the second fruit drop. Likewise, from 2016-2017, the number of preadult codling moths decreased more in the flower strip plots as compared to the control plots resulting in reduced fruit damage. Our study shows on a wide continental scale that the implementation of perennial flower strips in the. alleyways between apple tree rows boosts natural enemies and reduces key apple pests and the associated fruit damage. This supports the role of functional agrobiodiversity as a way to potentially reduce insecticide use in orchards and thus further promote conservation of agrobiodiversity.

A case study from uk cider apple orchards,10.1016/j.agee.2017.01.005,"Flower strips are widely recommended as a tool to boost insect pollinators and yield in pollinator-dependeht crops. Using UK cider apple orchards (Mains domestica Borkhausen) as a model system, we assessed whether flower strips increased pollination services in orchards. Pollinator communities (visual observation) and pollination services (fruit set) were assessed at increasing distance from surrounding semi-natural habitats (0-200 m) in eight orchards. In four orchards, perennial flower strips had been established and bloomed in the year before the main experiment. In a separate experiment, insect visits to apple flowers were observed to investigate possible functional mechanisms underpinning pollinator efficacy. The visit rate of wild insects to apple flowers (non-Apis bees and flies), but not that of honeybees (Apis mellifera L.), increased by 40% in flower strip orchards compared to control orchards, particularly in areas close to semi-natural habitat (<100 m). Wild insect visitation was also positively related to dandelion (Taraxacum species) abundance in orchards. Fruit set in orchards was positively related to wild insect richness, and andrenid bee (Andrena species) visitation, but neither richness nor andrenid bee visit rate responded positively to flower strips. Wild bees (andrenid bees and bumblebees (Bombus species)) contacted apple stigma (95 and 100% of visits) more often than honeybees (81%), but only bumblebees moved frequently between different tree rows, an important trait for transfer of compatible pollen in apples. Our results demonstrate that flower strips enhanced overall wild insect abundance but not pollination services in cider orchards. Positive effects of ground flora on wild insect abundance in orchards suggest that flower mixtures or orchard management could be optimised for andrenid bees, the single most important pollinator taxa, by increasing the availability of early-flowering plants in orchards. Equally, wild insect richness was highest in areas close to semi-natural habitats. Therefore, whilst flower strips can boost abundance of the existing species pool, only large scale preservation of (semi-) natural habitat will maintain pollinator diversity in apple orchards.

Sown or natural flower strips are a commonly used management practice in agroecosystems and have been demonstrated to increase the abundance of predators of orchard pests.

We found orchard flower margins reduced the percentage of apple trees with fruit damage by D. plantaginea, from 80% to 48%. In 2021, a period of severe infestation (65% of trees had fruit damage), there was reduced spread of D. plantaginea on infested apple trees and the number of trees with fruit damage was significantly reduced up to 50 m into orchards. During 2022, a period of lower infestation (25% of trees damaged), fruit damage was significantly reduced up to 10 m from the flower margin. 4.

For this we need to develop targeted management solutions that provide critical resources to service-providing organisms at the right time and place. We tested whether annual strips of early flowering phacelia Phacelia tanacetifolia support pollinators and natural enemies of seed weevils Protapion spp., by attracting and offering nectar and pollen before the crop flowers. This was expected to increase yield of red clover Trifolium pratense seed. We monitored insect pollinators, pests, natural enemies and seed yields in a total of 50 clover fields along a landscape heterogeneity gradient, over 2years and across two regions in southern Sweden. About half of the fields were sown with flower strips of 125-2,000m(2). The clover fields were pollinated by 60% bumble bees Bombus spp. and 40% honey bees Apis mellifera. The clover seed yield was negatively associated with weevil density, but was unrelated to bee species richness and density. Flower strips enhanced bumble bees species richness in the clover fields, with the strongest influence in heterogeneous landscapes. There were few detectable differences between crop fields with and without flower strips. However, long-tongued bumble bees were redistributed toward field interiors and during phacelia bloom honey bees toward field edges. Clover seed yield also increased with increasing size of the flower strip. We conclude that annual flower strips of early flower resources can support bumble bee species richness and, if sufficiently large, possibly also increase crop yields. However, clover seed yield was mainly limited by weevil infestation, which was not influenced by the annual flower strips.

Planting a mixture of wildflowers in the unused margins of agricultural fields may help to conserve these insects and the important benefits that they provide (pollination and pest suppression). We compared wildflower plantings around commercial potato fields to unmanaged grass and weed margins to determine whether these plantings supported greater numbers of pollinators and predators. We found that wildflower plantings increased the numbers of both pollinators and predators within field margins. Additionally, margins with more flowers blooming led to more pollinators, although, interestingly, more flowers did not lead to more predators. This suggests that predators may benefit from wildflower plantings without needing the flowers they provide, while pollinators benefit from flowers specifically. When we measured pollinators and predators in the nearby potato crops, we found that wildflower plantings did not lead to greater numbers of pollinators or predators. Our results suggest that wildflower plantings can help conserve pollinators and predators in commercial agricultural areas, but that these beneficial insects do not move into adjacent crops, where they would be most likely to provide pollination or pest suppression services. Beneficial insect populations and the services that they provide are in decline, largely due to agricultural land use and practices. Establishing perennial floral plantings in the unused margins of crop fields can help conserve beneficial pollinators and predators in commercial agroecosystems. We assessed the impacts of floral plantings on both pollinators and arthropod predators when established adjacent to conventionally managed commercial potato fields. Floral plantings significantly increased the abundance of pollinators within floral margins compared with unmanaged margins. Increased floral cover within margins led to significantly greater pollinator abundance as well. The overall abundance of arthropod predators was also significantly increased in floral plantings, although it was unrelated to the amount of floral cover. Within adjacent potato crops, the presence of floral plantings in field margins had no effect on the abundance of pollinators or predators, although higher floral cover in margins did marginally increase in-crop pollinator abundance.

Most conservation/restoration efforts for bees aim to enhance floral abundance and continuity but often assume the same actions will bolster nesting opportunities. Recent research suggests that habitat plantings may not always provide both forage and nesting resources. We evaluated wildflower plantings designed to augment floral resources to determine their ability to enhance nesting by soil-nesting bees over 3 study years in Northern California agricultural landscapes. We established wildflower plantings along borders of annual row crops and paired each with an unplanted control border. We used soil emergence traps to assess nest densities and species richness of soil-nesting bees from spring through late summer at paired field borders planted with wildflowers or maintained conventionally as bare or sparsely vegetated areas, as is typical for the region. We also quantified soil-surface characteristics and flower resources among borders. Wildflower plantings significantly increased nest densities and the richness of bee species using them. Such benefits occurred within the first year of planting and persisted up to 4 years post establishment. The composition of nesting bee communities also differed between wildflower and unenhanced borders. Wildflower plantings differed from controls in multiple characteristics of the soil surface, including vegetation cover, surface microtopography and hardness.

However, the influence of field-edge plantings on crop pollination and yield is inconsistent. Planting size and richness did not change these results. While this analysis shows that field-edge flower plantings consistently increase pollinator abundance and richness, there remain critical gaps in our knowledge of when and how plantings can improve ecosystem service provision and delivery.

Flowering plants (providing pollen and nectar) and grasses (providing alternative prey) can benefit natural enemies in orchards; however, little is known about their relative importance. We studied the effect of management practices (flower strips, grass strips, and spontaneous grass) on arthropod predators under organic apple management regimes in apple orchards in Beijing, China. Orchards located at two different sites were assessed for 3 years (2017-2019). The cover crops had a significant impact on the abundance and diversity of arthropod predators. The grass treatment consistently supported significantly greater densities of alternative prey resources for predators, and predators were more abundant in the grass than in the other treatments. The Shannon-Wiener diversity was significantly higher for the cover crop treatment than for the control. Community structure was somewhat similar between the grass and control, but it differed between the flower treatment and grass/control. Weak evidence for an increase in mobile predators (ladybirds and lacewings) in the orchard canopy was found. Ladybirds and lacewings were more abundant in the grass treatment than in the other treatments in 2019 only, while the aphid abundance in the grass treatment was lowest. The fact that grass strips promoted higher predator abundance and stronger aphid suppression in comparison to the flower strips suggests that providing alternative prey for predators has great biocontrol service potential.

However, how the management of wildflower strips affects resource availability and utilisation by parasitoids has never been studied. Using orange orchards as a model system, three experimental alleyway management treatments were investigated: a control treatment where naturally occurring vegetation in the alleyways between rows of trees was managed under standard farm practice; a standard management wildflower treatment in which sown wildflower strips in alleyways were managed by cutting once a year; and an active management wildflower treatment, in which the wildflower strips in alleyways was managed by cutting three times a year. Wildflower strips under standard management prevented the seasonal decline of nectar, supporting fructose feeding in parasitoids across all three seasons. The abundance of floral and hemip-teran honeydew carbohydrate resources in the orchard alleyways and citrus canopy was consistently greater with the standard management treatment than the control or the active management treatments. In turn, this treat-ment was associated with twice the abundance of primary parasitoids than with the control and active man-agement treatments in both summer and autumn. In addition, in autumn, parasitoids were more likely to have recently fed on carbohydrate in the standard management treatment than in the other two alleyway treatments. Finally, greater carbohydrate feeding in parasitoids was associated with increased structural heterogeneity of vegetation within the orchard alleyways.

Typically, such strips are floristically species poor and are dominated by grasses. In the present study, we developed management practices to enhance the floristic and structural diversity of these existing strips for the benefit of spiders, a key provider of natural pest control in crops. 2 Across three UK arable farms, we investigated the benefits of: (i) scarification to create germination niches into which wildflower seeds were sown and (ii) the effect of graminicide applications to suppress grass dominance. Spiders were sampled twice per year (July and September) during 2008 and 2009. 3 The combination of scarification with wildflower seeds, as well as graminicide, resulted in the greatest wildflower cover and lowest grass cover, with a general trend of increased abundance of adult and juvenile spiders. The abundance of Pachygnatha degeeri, Bathyphantes gracilis and juvenile wolf spiders of the genus Pardosa was positively correlated with wildflower cover, probably reflecting increased prey availability. Sward structure was negatively correlated with Erigone atra, Oedothorax fuscus and juvenile Pardosa abundance. 4 Management that utilizes existing commonly adopted agri-environment options, such as grass buffer strips, represents a potentially important conservation tool for increasing the quantity and quality of invertebrate habitats. This can maximize opportunities for the provision of multiple ecosystem services, including pest regulation by predators such as spiders.

Additionally, local-scale manipulations such as planting floral strips are used at the field-level to provide resources for beneficial insects to increase their services. It has been proposed that the benefits of local manipulations will depend on the landscape context, with greater benefits in simplified landscapes and smaller benefits in landscapes with an abundance of non-crop resources. To test this, we used soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, and its coccinellid predators as a model system to elucidate the effects of habitat management and landscape on biocontrol services in soybean. We selected pairs of soybean fields in landscapes of varying composition and planted buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum, strips adjacent to one field in each pair. We measured coccinellid abundance and biocontrol in each field. Coccinellid abundance was higher in buckwheat than in control field margins in all landscapes, and coccinellid abundance in soybean was positively related to amount of semi-natural vegetation in the landscape. We found no evidence of an interaction between landscape and local variables, and biocontrol services were high in all contexts.

Introducing a sown wildflower component has the potential to increase dramatically the value of these buffer strips for a suite of native species, including butterflies. This study investigates management practices aiming to promote the establishment and maintenance of wildflowers in existing buffer strips. The effectiveness of two methods used to increase the establishment of wildflowers for the benefit of native butterfly species were tested, both individually and in combination. The management practices were: (1) the application of a selective graminicide (fluazifop-P-butyl) which reduces the dominance of competitive grasses; and (2) scarification of the soil which creates germination niches for sown wildflower seeds. A wildflower seed mix consisting of nine species was sown in conjunction with the scarification treatment. Responses of wildflowers and butterflies were monitored for two years after establishment. Results indicate that the combined scarification and graminicide treatment produced the greatest cover and species richness of sown wildflowers. Butterfly abundance, species richness and diversity were positively correlated with sown wildflower species richness, with the highest values in the combined scarification and graminicide treatment. These findings have confirmed the importance of both scarification as a means of introducing wildflower seed into existing buffer strips, and subsequent management using graminicides, for the benefit of butterflies.

Agri-environment schemes (AES) are widely implemented across Europe to protect biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Grass field margins enriched with wildflowers typically out-perform grass-only margins in terms of increasing insect abundance and diversity. However, the effect of wildflower enrichment on moths remains largely unstudied. Here, the relative importance of larval hostplants and nectar resources for adult moths within AES field margins are investigated. Two treatments and a control were compared: (i) a plain grass mix, the control, (ii) a grass mix enriched with only moth-pollinated flowers, and (iii) a grass mix enriched with 13 wildflower species. Abundance, species richness and Shannon diversity were up to 1.4, 1.8 and 3.5 times higher, respectively, in the wildflower treatment compared to plain grass. The difference in diversity between treatments became greater in the second year. There was no difference in total abundance, richness or diversity between the plain grass treatment and grass enriched with moth-pollinated flowers. The increase in abundance and diversity in the wildflower treatment was due primarily to the provision of larval hostplants, with nectar provision playing a smaller role. The relative abundance of species whose larval hostplants included sown wildflowers increased in the second year, suggesting colonisation of the new habitat.Implications for insect conservation.We show that, at the farm scale, moth diversity can be greatly enhanced and abundance moderately enhanced by sowing diverse wildflower margins, providing these insects with both larval hostplants and floral resources, compared to grass-only margins.",Agri-environment scheme; Agro-ecology; Field margins; Floral resources; and Insect conservation; Moth conservation; Nectar resources,AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; SOWN WILDFLOWER STRIPS; CONSERVATION; and FARMLAND; BIODIVERSITY; LEPIDOPTERA; ARTHROPODS; EUROPE; MANAGEMENT; and PREFERENCE,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,27,3,455,465,Article,J,UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences and Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research; UK Centre for Ecology & and Hydrology (UKCEH); Lancaster University,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,77,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We studied the responses of two herbivorous insect groups, Heteroptera (true bugs) and Auchenorrhyncha (leaf-hoppers), to the properties of wildflower strips in a three-year (2008-2010) study in southern Finland. The experiment was replicated in six reed canary grass fields. The insect groups showed opposite responses; the abundance of Auchenorrhyncha was lower while the abundance and species richness of Heteroptera was higher in wildflower than control strips. During succession, both species richness and abundance of Auchenorrhyncha increased unlike Heteroptera. This difference could largely be explained by dietary differences. Auchenorrhyncha, including several grass feeders, could not take advantage of the increasing dicot species richness like Heteroptera species. This was also a likely reason for the unexpected finding that only Heteroptera species richness depended on the placement of the strip, being higher near field margins than in mid-field.

We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of different field margin management strategies for putting bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity back into intensive grasslands. Using four intensive livestock farms in south-west England, we manipulated conventional management practices (addition of inorganic fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to generate seven grass-based treatments along a gradient of decreasing management intensity. We also tested two more interventionist treatments which introduced sown components into the sward: (i) a cereal, grass and legume mix, and (ii) a diverse conservation mix with kale, mixed cereals, linseed and legumes. These crop mixtures were intended to provide forage and structural resources for pollinators but were not intended to have agronomic value as livestock feed. Using a replicated block design, we monitored bumblebee and butterfly responses in 27 plots (10 x 50 m) in each farm from 2003 to 2006. Bumblebees were most abundant, species-rich and diverse in the sown treatments and virtually absent from the grass-based treatments. The diverse conservation mix treatment supported larger and more diverse bumblebee assemblages than the cereal, grass and legume mix treatment. The sown treatments, and the most extensively managed grass-based treatments, had the highest abundance, species richness and diversity of adult butterflies, whereas butterfly larvae were only found in the grass-based treatments. Bumblebee and butterfly assemblage structure was driven by floral abundance, floral richness, the availability of nectar resources, and sward structure. Only vegetation cover was correlated with butterfly larval abundance. Synthesis and applications. This study has identified management options in the margins of intensive grasslands which can enhance bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity. Extensification of conventional grass management by stopping fertilization, reducing cutting frequency and not grazing, benefits butterflies.

We created two novel wildflower mixes: a wild bee mix based on primary research (WB) and one on literature-based evidence (LT). We trialled our novel mixes against two standard AES wildflower mixes: a Fabaceae-heavy mix (FAB); a diverse wildflower mix (WF); plus a fallow plot (control). Our aim was to determine which mix attracted the highest overall insect pollinator abundance and highest species richness for wild bees. 3. Our WB mix attracted both the highest number of total insect visitors, and the highest wild bee abundance and richness. WB attracted significantly more bumblebees (abundance and richness) than the typical low diversity, Fabaceae-heavy mix (FAB); and significantly greater solitary bee abundance, than all other treatments. 4. Only 11 'key' wildflower species were required to cater to all wild bee species recorded during the study, eight of which were sown species. Taraxacum officinale agg., Cirsium vulgare, Daucus carota and Geranium pyrenaicum received the highest numbers of wild bee species visits. 5.

Opportunities to restore habitat for bumblebees on uncropped arable field margins are now available, although the methods by which this restoration can be achieved have not been fully investigated. We present the results of a three year study undertaken to investigate the response of foraging bumblebees to five different arable field margin treatments (sown and unsown), as part of a replicated field experiment on arable farmland in northern England (UK). Bumblebee abundance was closely linked to successional changes in availability of suitable forage plant species. Field margin treatments sown with a `grass and wildflower' mixture had the highest bumblebee abundance, and provided a consistent supply of forage species, with different components of the seed mixture flowering in each year. The unsown natural regeneration treatment attracted foraging bumblebees in only the second year due to the local abundance of thistles, so we consider this option to be both inconsistent in terms of forage provision and agronomically unacceptable. Our results are discussed in terms of developing suitable measures to achieve the restoration of habitats for bumblebees on arable farmland. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines the long-term effectiveness of four different management strategies to enhance and restore bumblebee foraging habitat on arable field margins in two regions with markedly contrasting landscape structure, farming systems and amount of semi-natural habitat. Bumblebees were monitored on 120 field margins in July and August, together with estimates of flower abundance and the vegetation composition. There were no differences in the abundance and diversity of the bumblebee assemblage between the two regions (East Anglia and the West Midlands), despite a greater abundance of flowers and flowering species on the lighter soils of the West Midlands. Very few bumblebees were recorded on intensively managed cereal field margins due to the lack of dicot species. Conservation headlands supported a significantly greater number of flowering dicots, but the majority of these were annuals which did not provide good forage for bumblebees. From an agronomic and ecological perspective, the removal of field margins from the cropping system was the best strategy for providing foraging habitat for bumblebees. Non-crop habitat resulting from natural regeneration provided good foraging habitat for bumblebee species, but most of the key forage species were pernicious weeds of agriculture (Cirsium spp.). Sowing non-crop field margins with wildlife seed mixtures had the potential for providing the best foraging habitat for bumblebees, so long as preferred forage species were introduced (e.g. Trifolium pratense). Further research is required to refine and target this management prescription for bumblebee conservation in the wider countryside.",NA,NA,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,121,4,NA,NA,Article,J,NA,NA,ConservationEvidence,NA,grey,CE,TRUE,0,NA,1,85,FALSE,Y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, despite a high dependency on these strips to enhance biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, it appears that benefits for farmland birds during the breeding season have been limited. We investigated the provision of plant and invertebrate resources for farmland birds in buffer strips that were established with three different seed mixes, including the standard grass-only habitat. We hypothesised that resource provision would differ between seed mix types due to differences in original composition. We also investigated three different types of management aimed at influencing sward composition and habitat structure, namely cutting, scarification and the application of graminicide. These approaches were used to influence the accessibility of structurally complex swards to farmland birds. We hypothesised that the abundance of plant and invertebrate resources and access to these resources would be directly related to management type. The abundance of plant resources and sward structure were determined using quadrats and the drop disc method respectively, whilst the invertebrates were assessed using suction sampling. The study demonstrated the value of including forbs (herbaceous plant species) in seed mixes used to establish buffer strips by increasing plant resources for farmland birds, although this was not coupled with an increase in beetle abundance and mass. However, grass-only buffer strips managed with annual cutting were shown to provide similar levels of invertebrate resources to farmland birds as with the more complex seed mixes, but it is likely that access to these resources was restricted by tall homogenous swards and a limited amount of bare ground. The study demonstrated that novel buffer strip management techniques can strongly influence both the resource abundance and resource access by farmland birds. Scarification in particular was shown to be highly effective at opening up the sward to increase access by farmland birds, but was associated with a reduction in plant resources. Given the financial barriers for the use of seed mixes that contain forbs to establish buffer strips, importantly the study has shown that the value of existing grass-only buffer strips for farmland birds can be enhanced through the use of scarification. Consequently, as an alternative to annual cutting, we recommend that scarification is periodically applied to narrow (1-3 m) strips next to the crop edge to enhance the value of grass-only buffer strips for farmland birds.

Provision of sufficient forage resources is a key element for promoting bee populations within human impacted landscapes, particularly those in agricultural lands where demand for pollination service is high and land use and management practices have reduced available flowering resources. Recent government incentives in North America and Europe support the planting of wildflowers to benefit pollinators; surprisingly, in North America there has been almost no rigorous testing of the performance of wildflower mixes, or their ability to support wild bee abundance and diversity. We tested different wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three regions of North America where production of pollinator-dependent crops is high: Florida, Michigan, and California. In each region, we quantified flowering among wildflower mixes composed of annual and perennial species, and with high and low relative diversity. We measured the abundance and species richness of wild bees, honey bees, and syrphid flies at each mix over two seasons. In each region, some but not all wildflower mixes provided significantly greater floral display area than unmanaged weedy control plots. Mixes also attracted greater abundance and richness of wild bees, although the identity of best mixes varied among regions. By partitioning floral display size from mix identity we show the importance of display size for attracting abundant and diverse wild bees. Season-long monitoring also revealed that designing mixes to provide continuous bloom throughout the growing season is critical to supporting the greatest pollinator species richness. Contrary to expectation, perennials bloomed in their first season, and complementarity in attraction of pollinators among annuals and perennials suggests that inclusion of functionally diverse species may provide the greatest benefit. Wildflower mixes may be particularly important for providing resources for some taxa, such as bumble bees, which are known to be in decline in several regions of North America. No mix consistently attained the full diversity that was planted.

Changes in land management practices have resulted in a loss of floral diversity in some areas, reducing the availability of bumblebee foraging resources. In order to determine the most effective way of increasing forage plant availability on degraded machair, a restoration trial was established in western Scotland and comprised four seed mixes and a fallow treatment. Treatments were monitored over 3 years in order to compare the relative abundance of bumblebees and their forage plants. Two mixes contained wildflower species; one mix is currently used to create bird and bee foraging habitat on nature reserves and the fourth is a commercially available grass mix. There was little variation in inflorescence and bumblebee abundance between treatments early on but marked differences emerged later in the season in all 3 years. By the end of the monitoring period, the wildflower treatments contained between four and eighteen times more inflorescences than other treatment types. Similar trends were observed in bumblebee abundances. Some of the rarest bumblebee species exist primarily in areas that have largely escaped agricultural intensification. In these areas it is important that habitat management is specifically targeted and translated into appropriate agri-environment schemes. We suggest that the most effective method for restoring bumblebee forage plants on machair is to sow wildflower-rich seed mixes and this should be combined with late cutting and winter grazing practices to maintain sward diversity over time. ?? 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Bombus campestris; Bombus hortorum; Bombus jonellus; Bombus lucorum; and Bombus muscorum; Bombus pascuorum [Habitat management / Machair and grassland restoration / ] [Food availability / Forage plant availability and / ] [Population density / Species abundance / ] [Grassland /  / ] and [Scotland /  / ].,Scotland; United Kingdom; Apoidea; Aves; Bombus muscorum; agricultural intensification; bee; conservation management; flower; forage; grassland; grazing; habitat management; land management; management practice; relative abundance; restoration ecology,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,17,3,491,502,Article,J,University of Stirling; Royal Society for Protection of Birds,Scopus,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,88,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male bumble bees. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based 'pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed. Establishment of 'floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other pollinators.

While many crops benefit from insect pollination, soft fruit crops, including strawberries are highly dependent on this ecosystem service to produce viable fruit. However, as a result of intensive farming practices and declining pollinator populations, farmers are increasingly turning to commercially reared bees to ensure that crops are adequately pollinated throughout the season. Wildflower strips are a commonly used measure aimed at the conservation of wild pollinators. It has been suggested that commercial crops may also benefit from the presence of noncrop flowers; however, the efficacy and economic benefits of sowing flower strips for crops remain relatively unstudied. In a study system that utilizes both wild and commercial pollinators, we test whether wildflower strips increase the number of visits to adjacent commercial strawberry crops by pollinating insects. We quantified this by experimentally sowing wildflower strips approximately 20 meters away from the crop and recording the number of pollinator visits to crops with, and without, flower strips. Between June and August 2013, we walked 292 crop transects at six farms in Scotland, recording a total of 2826 pollinators. On average, the frequency of pollinator visits was 25% higher for crops with adjacent flower strips compared to those without, with a combination of wild and commercial bumblebees (Bombus spp.) accounting for 67% of all pollinators observed. This effect was independent of other confounding effects, such as the number of flowers on the crop, date, and temperature. Synthesis and applications. This study provides evidence that soft fruit farmers can increase the number of pollinators that visit their crops by sowing inexpensive flower seed mixes nearby.

Most flower strips are composed of perennial species. Despite their ecological benefits, perennial flower strips are not widely adopted. Barriers to adoption include the long-term commitment required and concerns about weeds. This study explores whether annual flower strips might be feasible for more farmers. We conducted an on-farm experiment on five commercial farms in New York, USA. On each farm, we established four treatments. At maize planting time, we seeded an early-established planting (EP) treatment with a commercial mix of annual flowers. An early-established control (EC) was set up at the same time with no seeding. Four weeks later, we prepared a new seedbed for late-established planting (LP) and late-established control (LC) treatments. We observed significant effects of planting on plant species richness and Shannon diversity (F-test, p < .001). Planted treatments were more diverse than control treatments. However, there was no effect of establishment time on diversity. Both planting (F-test, p = .004) and establishment time (F-test, p = .04) affected the number of dicot species at the flowering stage, which was highest in the EP treatment. This flowering species richness was positively associated with spider abundance in sweep-net samples. Overall, our results demonstrate that annual flower strip establishment is possible even under weedy conditions. In addition, they show that a delay in planting date does not eliminate the benefits of this practice.

The former encourages annual plant species whereas the latter targets the provision of perennial plants, both may benefit foraging pollinators, many of which have declined in the UK since the 1980s. We surveyed thirty cultivated margins and thirty floristically enhanced grass margins across the UK for pollinators, which included bumblebees Bombus spp., solitary bees and hoverflies Syrphidae. Pollinator abundance was then related to margin attributes such as age, width, soil fertility and adjacent habitat type. For cultivated margins we also investigated relationships with cultivation and rotation, and for floristically enhanced margins time cut. Plant preferences of foraging pollinators were recorded in 2019. On cultivated margins, target annual plants were frequently recorded on plots and were repeatedly visited by pollinators with management significantly influencing visitation rates. For example, plots which had been created with ploughing attracted fewer solitary bees and bees overall than those created with minimum tillage. Annually rotated cultivated margins were associated with lower flower abundance, broad leaved species cover and vegetation heights which resulted in lower total bee abundance. We therefore advise that cultivated margins be left in situ on farmland over longer periods. Older floristically enhanced grass margins became dominated by grass and contained fewer flowerheads to support foraging pollinators. Compared to those established via natural regeneration, sown margins were associated with increased bee and Syrphidae abundance, which is probably linked to the high flowerhead abundance and coverage of broad-leaved species on sown plots. Our pollinator foraging data from 2019 showed that tolerance of some agricultural weeds should be advocated.

Sweet cherry production benefits from insect pollination, but the extent to which wildflower strips can boost pollinator visitation under polytunnels is unknown. 2. Wildflowers were established in alleyways between tree rows under polytunnels in 10 commercial cherry orchards. Their management involved either a single cut in September (Standard Wildflower Strips (SWS)) or being actively maintained to 20 cm with regular cutting (Actively Managed Wildflower Strips (AMWS)), compared with unsown Control Strips (CS). Flower visitors of cherry and wildflowers were recorded by visual observations for 3 years (2017-2019), while cherry production (quantity and quality) was assessed in 2019. 3. In total, 67 visitor species were identified; managed commercial species ( Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris) made up similar to 74% of all records. During the cherry blossom period (anthesis), AMWS had the highest visitor density to cherry blossoms compared with CS and SWS but no significant difference in harvestable fruit was recorded. After anthesis, greater visitor density, diversity and richness were observed in both wildflower treatments compared with CS, being greatest in SWS, which was consistent with differences in floral communities between treatments. 4. Although visitor density was not correlated with fruit set, pollinating insects were key for fruit yields and quality. Fruit set was similar to 17% from blossoms exposed to visitors compared with <1% when excluded. Furthermore, hand pollination resulted in similar to 32% fruit set, indicating greatest pollination deficits in CS (similar to 50%) compared with AMWS (similar to 28%) and SWS (similar to 35%). 5. Synthesis and applications. Sweet cherry is highly dependent on pollinators to underpin commercial yields, and pollination deficits exist under polytunnels.

As insects are sensitive to a variety of flower traits, we hypothesized that mixtures with high functional diversity attract and support a higher abundance and species richness of aphid flower visiting predators than mixtures with low functional diversity. During a field experiment, repeated over two years (2014 and 2015) in Gembloux (Belgium), aphid predators (i.e., lacewings, ladybeetles and hoverflies) were pan-trapped in five sown flower mixtures (including a control mixture, with three replicates of each mixture) of low to high functional diversity based on seven traits (i.e., flower colour, ultra-violet reflectance and pattern, start and duration of flowering, height and flower class, primarily based on corolla morphology). In both years, the species of flowering plants in the sown mixtures (i.e., sown and spontaneous flowers) were listed, and the realized functional diversity in each plot calculated. Over the two years, a high functional diversity was not associated with high abundance and richness of aphid predators.

Semi-natural habitats, such as field edge meadows and hedgerows, can be maintained to provide a diversity of flowering plants that can increase floral resources required by bees. An additional habitat enhancement practice is that of sowing strips of native prairie vegetation within row-cropped fields. In this study, conducted in Iowa, USA, we found that increases in both the abundance and diversity of floral resources in strips of native prairie vegetation within agricultural production fields greatly and positively influenced the bee community. The benefits to the bee community were important for both common and uncommon species and the effect may be strongest early in the season. Using networks of co-occurrence between plant and bee species, we were able to identify two native prairie plants, Ratibida pinnata and Zizia aurea, as potentially keystone resources that can be used to support native bees. When we evaluated the effect of reconstructed prairie strips on bees in the context of the surrounding landscape, we found that these conservation practices had positive effects on bees in agriculturally-dominated areas and that these effects were detectable in low to high complexity landscapes with 8-69% natural habitat. In landscapes dominated by crops with few pollen and nectar resources the inclusion of native prairie strips can buffer the decline of bees and effectively increase bee abundance and diversity.","Andrenidae; Apidae; Colletidae; Halictidae; Megachilidae [Conservation and measures /  / ] [Foraging /  / ] [Pollination /  / ] [Community and structure /  / ] [Population density / Abundance / ] [Cultivated land and habitat / Agricultural landscapes / ] [Physical factors / Season / ] and [Iowa / Guthrie, Linn, Marshall & Pottawattamie / ].",FLORAL RESOURCES; FILTER STRIPS; DIVERSITY; HYMENOPTERA; POLLINATION; and LANDSCAPE; RESTORATION; NETWORKS; PLANTS; EXTRAPOLATION,PLOS ONE,15,10,NA,NA,Article,J,Iowa State University; Iowa State University,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,98,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Europe intensive agricultural management has increased productivity to the detriment of floral resources vital for insect pollinators like bees, butterflies and hoverflies. While the creation of wildflower habitats has been widely used to re-establish such resources into arable ecosystems (e.g. sown into field margins), comparable low cost methods for enhancing floristic diversity in production grasslands are lacking. We investigated how simple and cheep seed mixtures based around three plant functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-leguminous forbs) could be used to enhance flowering resources to benefit insect pollinator communities over a four year period. We demonstrate that the abundance and species richness of pollinators was correlated with the increased availability of legume and non-legume forb flowers. While the flowering resources provided by agricultural cultivars of legumes declined rapidly once sown, the inclusion of a forb component within seed mixtures was effective in increasing the long-term persistence of these resources. As a result the abundance and species richness of insect pollinators over the four years showed greater stability where forbs were also sown. Sward management also played a role in the persistence of floral resources, with grazing more likely to maintain legume cover than cutting. In conclusion, we demonstrate that low cost seed mixtures can be used to enhance floristic diversity to benefit pollinators, although the continued value of these grasslands over time is dependent on complementarity between sown legumes and forbs. As permanent grassland covers c. 40% of the UK the enhancement of their floristic diversity has a huge potential to benefit insect pollinators. The type of land sharing approaches suggested here maintain modest agricultural productivity and so may be the most likely to achieve benefit to pollinators through wide-scale farmer uptake.

Field margins were sown with either tussock grass and forbs, fine grass and forbs or grass only seed mixtures. After an establishment year, field margins were managed using standard sward cuts, scarification, or graminicide application. For predatory beetles, overall density was greatest where tussock grasses were included within the seed mixtures, while the densities of phytophagous beetles were greatest where forbs were present. Unexpectedly, species rarefaction curves suggested that phytophagous beetle species richness was greatest where field margins were established using a grass only seed mixture. The structure of the beetle assemblages, i.e., the relative abundances of individual species, was largely dependent on seed mixture, although margin management also played an important role. The results suggest that field margins established using seed mixtures containing tussock grasses and forbs would be expected to provide the greatest resources for beetles, at least at local scales. However, the use of a single standardised seed mixture for margin establishment would result in a homogenisation of beetle assemblages at a regional scale. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Three different sown seed mixtures were used to establish field margins, a Countryside Stewardship mix, a fine grass and forbs mix and a tussock grass and forbs mix. The structure of beetle communities in the first full year of establishment was found to show no difference between the tussock grass and Countryside Stewardship margins. However, both differed from the fine grass margins, which supported lower overall abundance and species richness of beetles. This was attributed to small-scale architectural differences between species of fine and tussock grasses, rather than differences in plant composition. Body size distributions of beetles showed distinct similarities between the Countryside Stewardship and tussock margins. A greater abundance of large beetles was found in fine grass margins, although in all cases these body size distributions were attributed to a small number of species or a taxonomically distinct group.

However, restored margins may harbour both pests and natural enemies. The aim was to compare the abundance of pests and natural enemies in three types of margins (unmanaged, sown herbaceous floral strips and shrubby hedgerows) as well as in adjacent melon fields. Besides, yield was compared among melon fields as way of testing the effect of the type of margin on biocontrol. The research was carried out during 2??years in twelve melon fields from four different locations in southern Spain. Arthropods were sampled periodically in margins and melon fields by visual inspections and Berlese extraction. Hedgerow and floral strips hosted higher numbers of both pests and predators than unmanaged margins. Besides, hedgerows had a similar or higher number of natural enemies than floral strips but lower number of pests. In just a few occasions, the type of margin had a significant effect on the abundance of pests and natural enemies in melon fields, but rarely there was consistency between the two growing seasons. No differences were found in yield. We hypothesised that the lack of association in the abundances of pests and natural enemies between margins and melon fields could be attributed to the overriding effects of the landscape and/or the internal population dynamics of arthropods in melon fields.

Fourteen species were recorded. For the first two years the control and/or the tussocky grass margins had the highest species richness, number and biomass. In 2014 the 90:10 margin produced the most earthworms while the tussocky grass margin had the highest biomass. Both the 90:10 and tussock grass margins had identically high species richness that year. The most abundant species were the endogeic earthworms Allolobophora chlorotica (Savigny), Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny) and Aporrectodea rosea (Savigny) which accounted for ca. 91% of the total number of earthworms found in 2012, but only 61% of the total in 2014. The numbers of anecic earthworms Aporrectodea longa (Ude) and Lumbricus terrestris L. increased over the same period. The highest numbers and biomass were during the wettest year (2012) and the lowest numbers and biomass were during the driest year (2013). Earthworm numbers were positively correlated with annual rainfall. Total species richness for the four margins increased throughout the study, indicating that the field margin soil ecosystems may have still been recovering four to six years after they had been established by ploughing and sowing in 2008. The tussocky grass margin had the greatest species richness each year. Although grassy field margins appeared to be better than floristically-enhanced field margins for preserving and/or enhancing earthworm biodiversity, floristically-enhanced field margins are more advantageous for pollinators and predators than grassy margins. So a balanced approach of some grassy margins, perhaps on the northern edges of fields or in the shadow of hedgerows, combined with flowery margins on the sunny southern field edges would provide the best of both worlds, the former helping preserve and enhance earthworm biodiversity (and soil fertility) while the latter does the same for ""aerial"" biodiversity.","Megadrili [Biomass /  / ] [Species diversity / Species richness / ] and [Population dynamics /  / ] [Soil habitat /  / ] [Cultivated land and habitat / Agricultural field margins / ] [England / Berkshire, Jealott's and Hill / ].",NA,BRITISH JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY,32,4,NA,NA,Article,J,NA,WoS,ZR,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,106,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Practical and effective approaches are needed to maintain wild pollinator populations within agroecosystems so they can deliver critical pollination services that underpin crop production. We established nesting and wildflower habitat interventions in 24 UK apple orchards and measured effects on flower-visiting insects and the pollination they provide, exploring how this was affected by landscape context. We quantified the extent of pollination deficits and assessed whether the management of wild pollinators can reduce deficits and deliver improved outcomes for growers over 3 years. Wildflower interventions increased solitary bee numbers visiting apple flowers by over 20%, but there was no effect of nesting interventions. Other pollinator groups were influenced by both local and landscape-scale factors, with bumblebees and hoverflies responding to the relative proportion of semi-natural habitat at larger spatial scales (1000m), while honeybees and other flies responded at 500m or less. By improving fruit number and quality, pollinators contributed more than 16k pound per hectare. However, deficits (where maximum potential was not being reached due to a lack of pollination) were recorded and the extent of these varied across orchards, and from year to year, with a 22% deficit in output in the worst (equivalent to similar to 14k pound/ha) compared to less than 3% (equivalent to similar to 2k pound/ha) in the best year. Although no direct effect of our habitat interventions on deficits in gross output was observed, initial fruit set and seed set deficits were reduced by abundant bumblebees, and orchards with a greater abundance of solitary bees saw lower deficits in fruit size. The abundance of pollinators in apple orchards is influenced by different local and landscape factors that interact and vary between years. Consequently, pollination, and the extent of economic output deficits, also vary between orchards and years.

Several strategies have been undertaken to counteract or halt this decline, one of which is the implementation of wildflower fields. These supplementary flowers provide extra food resources and have proven their success in increasing pollinator biodiversity and abundance. Yet such landscape alterations could also alter the host-pathogen dynamics of pollinators, which could affect the populations. In this study, we investigated the influence of sown wildflower fields on the prevalence of micro-parasites and viruses in the wild bumble bee Bombus pascuorum, one of the most abundant bumble bee species in Europe and the Netherlands. We found that the effect of sown wildflower fields on micro-parasite prevalence is affected by the composition of the surrounding landscape and the size of the flower field.

However, the combined exposure to pesticides and loss of flower resources, driven by agricultural intensification, contribute to declining diversity and abundance of many bee taxa. Flower plantings along the margins of agricultural fields offer diverse food resources not directly treated with pesticides. To investigate the potential of flower plantings to mitigate bee pesticide exposure effects and support bee reproduction, we selected replicated sites in intensively farmed landscapes where half contained flower plantings. We assessed solitary bee Osmia lignaria and bumble bee Bombus vosnesenskii nesting and reproduction throughout the season in these landscapes. We also quantified local and landscape flower resources and used bee-collected pollen to determine forage resource use and pesticide exposure and risk. Flower plantings, and their local flower resources, increased O. lignaria nesting probability. Bombus vosnesenskii reproduction was more strongly related to landscape than local flower resources. Bees at sites with and without flower plantings experienced similar pesticide risk, and the local flowers, alongside flowers in the landscape, were sources of pesticide exposure particularly for O. lignaria. However, local flower resources mitigated negative pesticide effects on B. vosnesenskii reproduction. Synthesis and applications. Bees in agricultural landscapes are threatened by pesticide exposure and loss of flower resources through agricultural intensification. Therefore, finding solutions to mitigate negative effects of pesticide use and flower deficiency is urgent. Our findings point towards flower plantings as a potential solution to support bee populations by mitigating pesticide exposure effects and providing key forage.

In the case of open field melon crops, the main pitfall would be to generate aphid and aphid-borne virus reservoirs near the crops. Combining biotests under controlled conditions and data from the literature, we assessed 18 candidate plant species, and ruled-out those posing a potential risk of hosting Aphis gossypii (melon pest and virus vector), Myzus persicae (virus vector) and/or viruses (Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) and Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV)). Five plant species made it through the selection process: cornflower, grass pea, sainfoin, salad burnet and sweet marjoram. Flower strips sown with a mix of these five plant species were evaluated in a five-year field experiment. They displayed a flowering continuum likely to provide a food resource to natural enemies throughout the growing season. Their potential to host natural enemies was compared to those of grass strips and bare soil by monitoring generalist and specialist predators within the different field margins and melon crop. Flower margins supported significantly more of these natural enemies than grass margins and bare soil. All predator taxa analyzed responded positively to the floral resources displayed.

Yet, biodiversity conservation does not guarantee ecosystem services provision, given species' variable responses to local and landscape factors. Here, we evaluate how the landscape and local resources affect parasitoid diversity and aphid biological control in a tropical organic crop. Locally, we compared parasitoid communities within the crops and on adjacent non-crop plant strips and evaluated the effect of flower resource abundance on parasitoid diversity. At the landscape scale, we analyzed the effect of natural areas and their specific vegetational types on parasitoid diversity and the scale of these effects. Finally, we evaluated the relationship between biodiversity and biological control. Non-crop plant strips had higher parasitoid species richness and abundance than the crops, but similar species composition. Flower resource abundance in the non-crop strips negatively affected parasitoid richness. Natural areas in the landscape benefited parasitoid richness at a close range (0.42 km) and reduced parasitoid abundance at a wider scale (1.75 km). Forests and savannas increased parasitoid richness and reduced abundance, while grasslands drive parasitoid abundance and may disrupt species richness. Savannah areas, where trees and grasses coexist boosted the positive effects of forests on species richness and of grasslands on abundance. Parasitoid species richness benefited biological control exclusively in communities with intermediate and high number of parasitoid species. Our findings show that natural vegetation types with different wood densities have complementary effects in parasitoid diversity in tropical agroecosystems and represent a useful baseline for development of management and zoning plans. ?? 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Agroecology; Scale dependency; Conservation biological control; and Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Tropics,NATURAL ENEMY BIODIVERSITY; PEST-CONTROL SERVICES; FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; and ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; FLOWER ATTRACTIVENESS; LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; CROP PEST; and CONSERVATION; ABUNDANCE; NECTAR,"AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT",374,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade de Brasilia; Empresa Brasileira and de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),Scopus,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,117,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Intensive agricultural monocultures provide abundant food to specialized herbivores and at the same time negatively impact natural enemies because monocultures are depauperate in carbohydrate food sources required by many natural enemies. As a consequence, herbivores are released from both types of control. Diversifying intensive cropping systems with flowering plants that provide nutritional resources to natural enemies may enhance top-down control and contribute to natural herbivore regulation. We analyzed how noncrop flowering plants planted as companion plants inside cabbage (Brassica oleracea) fields and as margins along the fields affect the plant-herbivore-parasitoid-predator food web. We combined molecular analyses quantifying parasitism of herbivore eggs and larvae with molecular predator gut content analysis and a comprehensive predator community assessment. Planting cornflowers (Centaurea cynanus), which have been shown to attract and selectively benefit Microplitis mediator, a larval parasitoid of the cabbage moth Mamestra brassicae, between the cabbage heads shifted the balance between trophic levels. Companion plants significantly increased parasitism of herbivores by larval parasitoids and predation on herbivore eggs. They furthermore significantly affected predator species richness. These effects were present despite the different treatments being close relative to the parasitoids' mobility. These findings demonstrate that habitat manipulation can restore top-down herbivore control in intensive crops if the right resources are added. This is important because increased natural control reduces the need for pesticide input in intensive agricultural settings, with cascading positive effects on general biodiversity and the environment. Companion plants thus increase biodiversity both directly, by introducing new habitats and resources for other species, and indirectly by reducing mortality of nontarget species due to pesticides.",Mamestra brassicae [Food plants /  / ] [Hymenopteran parasites / and Microplitis mediator / ] [Habitat / Habitat manipulation / ]. and Microplitis mediator [Lepidopteran hosts / Mamestra brassicae / Larva].,ENHANCE BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; DIADEGMA-SEMICLAUSUM; GENERALIST PREDATORS; and PARASITIC WASP; OLFACTORY ATTRACTIVENESS; HABITAT MANAGEMENT; NATURAL and ENEMIES; CABBAGE PESTS; BOTTOM-UP; BIODIVERSITY,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,3,8,2634,2646,Article,J,University of Basel; University of Basel; Swiss Tropical & Public Health and Institute; University of Innsbruck; University of Basel,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,118,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A trial was conducted to determine the contribution of field margin vegetation and cropping systems to natural enemies of bean aphids (Aphis fabae) on Lablab purpureus, an orphan crop legume. Natural enemy populations were surveyed in plots with a combination of lablab monocrop or maize-lablab intercrop and with or without planted field margins comprising four plant species (Chenopodium album, Bidens pilosa, Galinsoga parviflora and Tagetes minuta), arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates. A cage experiment was also conducted to understand the extent to which these field margin plants supported the parasitoid wasp, Aphidius colemani, to parasitize bean aphids. A total of 2029 insects from 10 families were collected using sticky cards and pan traps. In comparison to plots with no field margin plants, the presence of plant-rich field margins increased abundance of natural enemies by 9.5% and supported higher populations of Braconidae (parasitoids) and damsel bugs (predators). The maize-lablab intercrop had 15.5% lower abundance of natural enemies than the lablab monocrop. Higher grain yield was recorded in plots with a field margin vegetation (300 kg ha?¨¤¨ª1) compared to plots without field margin vegetation (210 kg ha?¨¤¨ª1). The presence of a companion plant did not significantly affect the performance of parasitoids, in the cage experiment, indicating that parasitoids were not limited by access to food. In supporting aphid parasitization, B. pilosa was associated with the highest number of mummies (8.28). The lowest number of mummies were observed in cages with T. minuta (3.44).

We also examined the potential of these two plants to enhance biocontrol services by parasitoid wasps when planted on the bunds of subtropical rice fields. In the laboratory, both plants and especially passion fruit increased parasitoids' longevity and fecundity. Both plants also increased field abundance of parasitoid wasps and slightly increased pest control services, as shown by a lower herbivorous insects to parasitoid wasps ratio, although pest numbers remained high.

However, they may also draw pollinators away from the crop, serve as overwintering and/or refugia sites for SWD, and increase the abundance of wild birds that feed on fruit and harbor foodborne pathogens. The objective of this 1-year, observational study was to explore the potential impacts of border vegetation adjacent to commercial highbush blueberry fields on pollination, crop productivity, and arthropod and bird communities within the Pacific Northwest region in the United States. The study included three highbush blueberry cultivars (Duke, Draper, and Liberty), and three field border vegetation treatments: 1) woody perennial vegetation; 2) herbaceous vegetation; and 3) medium-height grasses (control). There was one border treatment per cultivar for a total of nine sites. No cultivar effects nor interactions for any of the variables were detected, so results were combined across cultivars. No differences in pollinator abundance, pollinator visitation rates, estimated yield, berry weight, and seed number were observed across the treatments. Herbaceous borders had more natural enemies than the woody perennial borders, but both were similar to the control. This trend is attributed to higher abundances of parasitic wasps (suborder Apocrita) in the herbaceous and control borders compared with the woody perennial borders. Increased abundances of aphids (family Aphididae), a host for parasitic wasps, likely influenced these results. Differences in predatory arthropods were not observed. Insect abundances were overall low in all field sites measured in this study, likely influenced by SWD insecticide applications. There were no differences in total wild bird density by treatment except for barn swallows (Hirundo rustica), which were greatest in the control treatment. Overall, the border treatments evaluated in this study had small-to-negligible impacts on the measured variables, and there was no clear crop production benefit. Additionally, none of the investigated border treatments negatively impacted highbush blueberry production.

Adding strips of diverse, native, perennial vegetation, through the recently created prairie strips practice of the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program, into annual cropland reduces soil and nutrient loss, and supports more diverse and abundant communities of birds and insects, including native pollinators. It remains unclear if prairie strips can reverse declines in the health and productivity of the exotic honey bee in the U.S.This study determined if prairie strips provide floral resources to honey bees and support colony vigour, in a highly farmed landscape with limited perennial habitat. We hypothesized that honey bee health and productivity would be improved if given access to prairie strips, and this hypothesis was tested in a multi-year, replicated, longitudinal study on commercial, conventional farms committed to corn and soybean production with and without prairie strips. We predicted that prairie strips would have more diverse flowering plants, and colonies located in these strips would be healthier and more productive than colonies kept at farms without purposefully established native vegetation (i.e. control fields).We found that prairie strips had more diverse flowering plants and abundant floral resources than control fields. Colonies kept at fields with prairie strips collected 50% more pollen during the growing season (June-September), had a 24% larger end-of-season worker bee populations, and 20% higher overwinter survival than colonies kept at control fields. Furthermore, colonies kept at prairie strips were 24% heavier when they reached their peak-weight in August, an indicator of honey production.Honey bees collected pollen from flowering plants found in prairie strips, revealing the potential for interactions with wild pollinators. However, this was limited to 50% of the taxa in prairie strips, suggesting honey bees may not deplete all of the food resources simultaneously used by wild pollinators.Synthesis and applications.

Here we present the results of a season-long study into how targeted floral mixes can be used to increase the populations of distinct suites of beneficial insects in cider apple orchards, and whether we can build 'multi-functional' flowering strips by combining targeted mixes, without introducing trade-offs in beneficial insect density. Flower mixes were sown in 40 m strips between rows of apple trees in four intensively-managed, commercial cider orchards in Herefordshire, SouthWest England. The two 'single-target' mixes contained plant species that were deemed attractive to either natural enemy groups, or bumblebee pollinators, based on previous literature; and a third 'multi-functional' (MF) mix that contained all species from each targeted mix, but sown at half the rate. Flowering strips significantly out-performed areas under normal management (controls) in terms of both flowering density and beneficial insect abundance, although MF plots could not match flowering densities in targeted mixes for individual plant species. Insects responded to the targeted mixes in line with expectation, with bee pollinators favouring the mix containing flowers with long, tubular corollae, whereas natural enemies preferred the targeted mix containing open-nectar plants.

Agri-environment schemes in Europe aim to counteract the continuous decrease of permanent grassland habitat and related decline of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We established new grasslands adjacent to permanent old grasslands to study effects on arthropod pollinators and predators. Over three years, we assessed the effects of newly established grasslands on activity density, species richness and assemblages of pollinators (syrphids, bumblebees, solitary bees) and ground-dwelling predatory arthropods (carabids, spiders, ants). Pollinator activity density and species richness of all three pollinator groups approximately doubled in newly established grasslands compared to old grasslands, indicating suitability of new grasslands as pollinator feeding habitat. Predator responses were less consistent. Species richness and activity density of carabids and ants did not increase in new grasslands, indicating slower adaptation to new habitats. Spider activity density increased in the newly established grasslands and in adjacent cereal fields, but no significant differences in species richness compared to old grasslands were observed. Bumblebees and solitary bees showed distinct distance decays in cereal fields. Syrphid activity density declined in cereal fields far away from the newly established grasslands, but not nearby. Carabids increased and ants decreased in species richness and activity density with increasing distance from old grasslands in cereal fields and newly established grasslands alike. In contrast, spider species richness and activity density decreased with increasing distance from old grasslands in cereal fields only, but there was no distance decay in newly established grasslands. While pollinators utilized the additional floral resources within the whole area of newly established grassland quickly, predators reacted much slower. Even after three years, there was no measurable response of carabid and ant activity density and only a minor response of spiders. This clearly shows that short-term measures are not sufficient to sustainably conserve farmland biodiversity. The conservation of permanent grassland and landscape heterogeneity should be prioritized.

Simultaneously, environmental subsidy and conservation programmes have incentivized farmers to establish flower strips to support wild and managed pollinators. To find out if flower strips enhance, and competition from honey bees suppresses, wild bees in the landscape and across seasons, we surveyed bumble bee and honey bee abundances in 16 sites in Sweden in summer 2018. The centre of each site (2 km radius) was with or without an annual flower strip, and with or without added honey bee hives. We surveyed bees in each flower strip and in linear habitats in the landscape around each site, such as field edges and road verges. In the following spring, we surveyed bumble bee queen abundance in each site. We show that adding flower strips benefits bumble bee queen abundance the following year, but this effect is diminished if honeybee hives are added. In sites with flower strips, added honey bee hives reduced male bumble bee abundance. Our relatively small flower strip areas bolstered bumble bee population growth across seasons, probably by relieving a resource bottleneck. Adding honey bee hives in combination with flower strips to landscapes with few floral resources should be avoided as it cancelled the positive effect of flower strips. ?? 2021 The Authors",Apis mellifera; Bombus [Conservation measures / Enhancemnet of flower and strips / ] [Food plants / Anethum graveolens / ] [ / Centaurea cyanus / and ] [ / Fagopyrum esculentum / ] [ / Phacelia tanacetifolia / ] [ / and Trifolium incarnatum / ] [ / Trifolium resupinatum / ] [ / Vicia faba / and ] [Food availability / Resource availability / ] [Aggregating behaviour and /  / ] [Population dynamics / Abundance / ] [Cultivated land habitat / and Agricultural landscape / ] [Sweden / Skane Province / ].,Sweden; Apis mellifera; Bombus (genus); Vicia faba; abundance; agricultural land; bee; caste system; environmental economics; flower; flowering; incentive; male; population decline; population growth; wild population,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,263,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,Scopus,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,133,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This combined effect could result in losses of over 100 million per year for the UK economy. We investigated whether incorporating floral resources within commercial polythene-clad tunnels could improve pollination services and aphid control and, hence, strawberry fruit quality. In a randomised block experiment (using 3 x 6 m plots), coriander (Coriandrum sativum) field forget-me-not (Myosotis arvensis) and corn mint (Mentha arvensis) plants were inserted in rows of commercially-grown strawberries. Their effect on numbers of naturally occurring flower visitors, aphids and aphid predators was compared. Counts of flower visitors, including visitors to sown flower species, were higher in coriander and mint plots. However strawberry flowers received more insect visits in control plots. Fruit from forget-me-not plots were lower in sugar than fruit from controls, while fruit from mint plots had fewer fertilised seeds than fruit from control plots. Strawberries from coriander plots did not differ from control fruit on any fruit quality measures. Crucially, proportions of marketable fruit did not differ across treatments. Aphid numbers did not differ between treatments even though coriander significantly increased the numbers of lacewing eggs laid on aphid-infested strawberry plants in coriander plots. Hence, although there were no negative effects on the proportions of marketable fruits with intercropping, the benefits received were limited.

In this study, inter cropping with Australian native flowering plants was compared with the use of an exotic plant, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) and naturally occurring weedy grass vegetation for the provision of multiple ecosystem services in a cabbage agroecosystem. Among the native plants studied, Mentha satureioides had the most comprehensive positive effects on pest management. Compared with the grassy control, M. satureiodides significantly enhanced parasitism of the pest, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) larvae and reduced pest Brevicoryne brassicae densities and was comparable to F. esculentum. Flowers of M. satureiodides appeared attractive to adult Pieris rapae and the adjacent cabbage foliage held high densities of this pest's eggs but, reflecting high densities of parasitoids and predators (especially spiders), larval densities were not elevated compared to other treatments. Lotus australis also enhanced natural enemies, especially coccinellids and spiders, but this did not translate into the ecosystem service of pest suppression. Swainsona galegifolia harboured elevated numbers of spiders but the adjacent crop did not benefit from enhanced enemy densities or suppressed pests. For complementary ecosystem services, pollinator abundance was enhanced by the exotic plant F. esculentum and two natives (L. australis and M. satureioides). Honey bees (Apis mellifera) were highly attracted to F. esculentum, while native bees were attracted to the native plants. Native butterflies were monitored as a proxy for benefit to native invertebrate biodiversity and two native plants (L. australis and M. satureioides) were found to be attractive. Soil biological activity, a proxy for soil-associated ecosystem services, was lower in the F. esculentum treatment compared to all other treatments.

In 2012 we surveyed the groundcover in nine cider-apple orchards to (I) identify the floral and faunal communities present in the ground floor, (II) assess the attractiveness of the local spontaneous flowers to insects and (III) determine the role that the flower community may play for the conservation of the associated arthropods in general and of pollinators in particular. The apple orchards provided a continuous succession of floral resources in the groundcover with differences among orchards in the abundance, richness and diversity of flowers. Flowering plant species were visited by a wide variety of insects, mostly from the orders Hymenoptera (70%) and Diptera (25%). Wild bees accounted for 27% of hymenopterans and hoverflies for 30% of dipterans. Flowering plants differed in the number of taxa they attracted and in their attractiveness for particular insect groups and for insects as a whole. A total of 16,159 arthropods were collected from the groundcover, and 2064 individuals belonged to taxa involved in the pollination. Pollinators and arthropods (exemplified by hemipterans and coleopterans) differed between orchards and periods and were affected by the plant community. Plant species richness and the abundance of some plant species favored the presence of both pollinators and arthropod assemblages while flower abundance had only a marginal effect on those communities. Pollinators were also affected by plant diversity. Among-orchard differences in the plant community suggest that management recommendations must be site-specific to ensure the permanent availability of diverse floral resources for the arthropod community and for pollinators in particular. Therefore, a proper groundcover management could provide benefits for apple growers by improving pollination services. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Over the last decades, biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has declined drastically. Initiatives to enhance biodiversity, such as agri-environment schemes, often have little effect, especially in intensively farmed landscapes. The effectiveness of conservation management may be improved by scheme implementation near high-quality habitats that can act as a source of species. We evaluated up to what distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created flower-rich patches) affect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands. 2. We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in transects along ditch banks extending 300 m from four nature reserves forming small islands in landscapes dominated by agriculture. 3. In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover flies in 1500 m long transects on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects. 4. Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species density and abundance of hover flies declined over the first 125 m beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further declines were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially limited. The species density and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch. 5. Synthesis and applications. In intensively farmed areas, remnant high-quality habitats sustain more abundant and diverse pollinator and forb communities than the surrounding countryside. They do enhance biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted (< 150 m) and relatively small. These habitats may therefore function only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or agricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in close proximity. Habitat restoration in intensively used farmland should therefore be implemented preferentially in the immediate vicinity of high-quality habitats. In the short term, newly created flower-rich habitats are no alternative to pre-existing seminatural habitats for the promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland.","Apoidea; Syrphidae [National parks and reserves / Nature reserves / ] and [Pollination /  / ] [Community structure /  / ] [Distribution within and habitat /  / ] [Impact on habitat / Impact on plant diversity / ] and [Cultivated land habitat / Intensively farmed landscapes / ] and [Netherlands / Gelderland, Limburg & Noord-Brabant / ].",AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; and SEED DISPERSAL; FIELD MARGIN; BIODIVERSITY; GRASSLAND; COMMUNITIES; and SYRPHIDAE; INSECTS,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,45,3,753,762,Article,J,"Wageningen University & Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology and Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Radboud University Nijmegen; and Wageningen University & Research",WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,TRUE,0,NA,1,137,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We identified and quantified floral resources, flower-visiting insects and insect-flower interaction networks over 2 years on four bird strips located in intensive agro-ecosystems in Belgium. 3 The bird strips contained plant species that were either purposely sown or established spontaneously. The spontaneous Cirsium species, with its high nectar production, offered floral resources that complemented those of the sown species Raphanus sativus and Phacelia tanacetifolia.

Planting floral resources along crop field margins may be a useful tactic to support communities of beneficial insects in agroecosystems. We examined the effect of planting buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) along lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) field margins on beneficial insect abundance and generic richness. We found that bee abundance was higher in buckwheat transects than control transects in 2014 and 2015, but not 2016, and that bee generic richness was higher in buckwheat transects than in control transects in 2015 only. High variability occurred across years. All bee genera recorded during blueberry bloom were also collected in buckwheat transects, suggesting buckwheat is a useful resource for the bee community involved in blueberry pollination. The effect of buckwheat on natural enemies was variable and inconsistent. We conclude that buckwheat influenced bee and natural enemy communities during certain years, but field edges in the lowbush blueberry fields studied may already adequately support beneficial insects.

Highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum, and tart cherry, Prunus cerasus, are spring-blooming crops that rely on the movement of pollen by bees and other insects for pollination. Wild bee populations can be increased on farmland by providing floral resources, but whether the addition of these plants translates into increased pollinator density on crop flowers has not been documented in most cropping systems. To determine the importance of providing additional floral resources for wild bee pollinator communities, we selected blueberry fields and tart cherry orchards with and without herbaceous floral enhancements in western Michigan, USA. The bee communities visiting crop flowers, enhancements and control grassy field margins were sampled over a 5-yr period. In addition, the pollen diets of the most abundant wild bee crop pollinators were quantified across Michigan to better understand their foraging niches and to identify potentially important alternative host plants. The presence of floral enhancements did not increase the abundance of wild bees on either blueberry or cherry flowers during bloom. The bee community visiting blueberry was evenly composed of short-season bees that fly only during the spring and long-season bees that fly in both spring and summer. In contrast, the bee community visiting cherry was dominated by short-season spring bees. The majority of pollen collected by the wild bee communities visiting blueberry and cherry was from spring-flowering woody plants, with limited use of the herbaceous enhancements. Enhancements attracted greater abundance and species richness of bees compared to control areas, including twice as many floral specialists. Conserving summer-flying, grassland-associated bees is an appropriate goal for pollinator conservation programs. However, herbaceous enhancements may not provide adequate resources for the wild bees that pollinate spring-flowering crops.

In all cases these prescriptions were compared to intensive crop management. The plant community regenerating from the seed bank was species-poor, highly dynamic and had a high proportion of undesirable crop weeds. Sowing a low-cost, simple mix of tall grasses resulted in a stable community dominated by competitive grasses. Creation of these habitats resulted in negligible shifts in the functional composition of the associated invertebrate community. Sowing a diverse mix of wildflowers resulted in a stable, perennial vegetation community with both legumes and regulating hemi-parasitic plants that supported significantly more pollinator and herbivore species, as well as higher abundances of beneficial arthropod predators. There were no measured synergies when a mix of tall grass and wildflower habitats were created adjacent to each other on the same margin.

Pollination is a crucial ecosystem service contributing to global food security. Moringa (Moringa oleifera) is an economically important tropical crop, mostly cultivated by smallholder farmers. 2. Well-established approaches of planting flower-rich patches used in temperate agroecosystems for pollination enhancement were adapted to tropical moringa systems. Based on existing evidence, we hypothesised that floral interventions would improve flower visitor diversity and abundance in the crop, thereby increasing pollination services and moringa yield and quality. 3. We used standardised methods to survey flower visitors on moringa and assess economically relevant measures of crop yield quality and quantity. We selected 24 moringa fields in Tamil Nadu, India, to compare fields with and without floral interventions. We planted red gram, Cajanus cajan as a border crop, and marigold, Tagetes erecta as an intercrop on moringa fields to enhance floral resource availability for pollinators. These interventions were co-designed with local farmers to ensure additional benefits to their community. 4. We found that flower visitor abundance and species richness were significantly (50% for abundance and 33% for species richness) greater in fields with floral interventions compared with control fields. We also found that the percentage of flowers that resulted in harvestable fruits were significantly (30%) greater in fields with floral intervention. Production benefits in yield and quality were significantly positively correlated with the abundance and species richness of flower visitors. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide clear evidence that floral interventions in the form of intercropping and border cropping can enhance pollinator communities and services they provide in tropical smallholder systems. These findings underpin a practical management option for farmers to enhance flower visitor communities and pollination services, which can potentially also provide additional cobenefits to farmers, improving livelihoods and sustainable production.",Insecta [Farming and agriculture / Intercropping & border cropping / and Floral intervention; pollination services] [Food availability / Resource and availability / ] [Pollination / Moringa oleifera / ] [Community and structure /  / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Moringa fields / ] [Tamil and Nadu /  / ].,INSECT POLLINATORS; BEES; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; OLEIFERA; FARMS; SIZE,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,61,1,90,102,Article,J,University of Reading,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,145,FALSE,Y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous work has demonstrated that the establishment of flowering plants can provide the necessary resources to support beneficial insects in agricultural landscapes, which can enhance beneficial insect populations in these regions. This dissertation evaluates how patch size and on-farm establishment of wildflower habitat supports beneficial insects and their delivery of ecosystem services.To investigate the response of insects to wildflower patch size and plant richness, 12 native perennial flowering plant species were established in 25 replicated patches ranging in size from 1 to 100 m2. With no significant differences in bloom density or flower richness across patch sizes, in general wild bees were observed at greater densities and higher diversity in larger patches. Conversely, honey bees and hoverflies did not respond to wildflower patch size, but all pollinators were positively influenced by increasing flower richness. Wildflower patch size was also important for natural enemy density, richness, and diversity. In contrast, there was only a slight increase in herbivore density with wildflower patch size.Through the investigation of pollination services delivered to three wildflower species with different bloom periods, patch area (positively), and floral richness (negatively), significantly influenced seed set of the measured wildflowers planted within the habitat patches. Comparing population growth of sentinel soybean aphids (Aphis glycines Matsumura) across wildflower patch size, aphid colonies were smaller as plot size increased, resulting in higher biocontrol service index values. Thus, providing beneficial insects with flowering resources resulted in significantly more beneficial insects and greater delivery of pollination and biological control services than in smaller habitat patches.Using highbush blueberry as a model system, wildflower plantings composed of 15 native perennial flowering plants and three native grass species were established adjacent to crop fields and evaluated for their efficacy at enhancing beneficial insect populations and their delivery of ecosystem services to the cropping system. Honey bees visiting blueberry flowers had similar abundance in enhanced and control fields, whereas wild bee abundance after three years was higher than in control fields. Pollination parameters including percent fruit set, berry weight, and mature seeds per berry were significantly greater in fields adjacent to wildflower plantings three and four years after seeding, leading to higher crop yields with value exceeding the cost of establishing and maintaining the plantings. Wildflower plantings also positively affected the density and diversity of some natural enemy groups and enhanced biological control of sentinel pest eggs along the crop edge. Conversely, insect herbivore densities generally were not enhanced by the provision of perennial floral resource plantings.The general patterns observed here can help guide future efforts in the conservation and support of beneficial insects in the natural and agricultural landscapes. The results from these studies suggest that small modifications to resource-poor, non-cropped areas within farms, such as through the establishment of native flowering plants, can selectively enhance biodiversity, pollination, pest-control, and thus has the potential to optimize multiple ecosystem services.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Dissertation/Thesis,B,Michigan State University,WoS,DT,NHM,grey,DT,FALSE,0,NA,1,146,FALSE,Y,AV,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One way to mitigate the harmful effects of agricultural intensification is through the re-introduction of native flowering plants as border strips that provide supplemental floral and nesting resources to pollinators. However, border crop species vary in bloom period and flower densities, and are thus likely to attract different suites of pollinator species. Resulting differences in pollinator community composition are likely to affect their ability to provide pollination services to adjacent crop habitat. To address these issues, we implemented a two-year study on the impact of different flowering border crops on pollinator abundance, richness, and community composition. We also examined which crop features (bloom duration, number of flowers, floral area) were most likely to affect pollinator densities. We found that native flowering plant border crops of diverse prairie mix and monocultures of silflower (Silphium integrifolium Michx.) and cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) attracted the highest abundance and species richness of bees and pollinator groups combined, while alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) attracted the highest lepidopteran abundance and species richness. We also found a significant, positive relationship between pollinator abundance and floral resource amount and bloom duration. These findings offer valuable insight into the impacts of different land management strategies on different pollinator groups, and thus provide landowners with management options for attracting specific pollinator groups and species.  ?? 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

In order to increase species diversity, agri-environment schemes provide subsidies to farmers who devote a fraction of their land to ecological compensation areas (ECAs). Several studies have shown that invertebrate biodiversity is actually higher in ECAs than in nearby intensively cultivated farmland. It remains poorly understood, however, to what extent ECAs also favour vertebrates, such as small mammals and their predators, which would contribute to restoring functional food chains within revitalised agricultural matrices. We studied small mammal populations among eight habitat types-including wildflower areas, a specific ECA in Switzerland-and habitat selection (radiotracking) by the Barn Owl Tyto alba, one of their principal predators. Our prediction was that habitats with higher abundances of small mammals would be more visited by foraging Barn Owls during the period of chicks' provisioning. Small mammal abundance tended to be higher in wildflower areas than in any other habitat type. Barn Owls, however, preferred to forage in cereal fields and grassland. They avoided all types of crops other than cereals, as well as wildflower areas, which suggests that they do not select their hunting habitat primarily with respect to prey density. Instead of prey abundance, prey accessibility may play a more crucial role: wildflower areas have a dense vegetation cover, which may impede access to prey for foraging owls. The exploitation of wildflower areas by the owls might be enhanced by creating open foraging corridors within or around wildflower areas. Wildflower areas managed in that way might contribute to restore functional links in food webs within agro-ecosystems.",Mammalia [Habitat management / Wildflower planting / predator prey and relationships; small taxa] [Population density /  / ] [Avian predators / and Tyto alba / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Agricultural land habitat / ] and [Switzerland / Payerne / ]. and Tyto alba [Habitat management / Wildflower planting / predator prey and relationships] [Mammalian prey /  / ] [Population density /  / ] and [Cultivated land habitat / Agricultural land habitat / ] [Switzerland / and Payerne / ].,NA,JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY,151,3,NA,NA,Article,J,NA,WoS,ZR,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,TRUE,0,NA,1,148,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They are important organisms in a wide range of habitats including agricultural and can be valuable agents in biological control. In this preliminary study we looked into how a floristically rich habitat for rove beetles functions in comparison to an adjacent maize crop which provides an unsuitable habitat for a majority of beneficial organisms. We assumed that the sowing of plant mixture might add to the richness of species and produce an abundance of rove beetles, and therefore increase their role in biological pest control. Beetles were trapped over two vegetation seasons in the experiment performed in Poland in 2013??¨¬2014. Individuals were identified to species level and classified according to their trophic group. In general, a more botanically diverse habitat resulted in more species rich beetle populations. A significantly greater number of species and individuals of beetles occurred in the plant mixture in comparison to the maize crop. The abundance and species richness increased after one year in both treatments. This might suggest that the positive effect of a more diverse habitat carries over into subsequent vegetation seasons. The species similarity coefficient indicates periodic migration of beetles from the plant mixture to maize crop. Considering trophic preferences, significantly more predators and fungivores occurred in more diverse habitats, while more parasitoids occurred in the maize crop.

Whereas perennial and managed non-crop habitats have known benefits, temporary non-crop patches within arable fields (field defects) have been poorly studied. We created artificial field defects (unsown patches) in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields and evaluated their effects on parasitoid assemblages at two crop growth stages. Moreover, we compared unmanaged patches with those sown with flowering plants (Onobrychis vicifolia) and crop controls and analyzed the influence of position within the field (edge or interior), and total flower availability. Altogether, we found almost 200 morphospecies of hymenopteran parasitoids (140 in unsown patches, 147 in Onobrychis patches, and 81 in controls), including important enemies of crop pests. Species richness and abundance were higher on both types of unsown patches than in controls but were not affected by Onobrychis sowing. The differences between unsown patches and controls were larger during oilseed ripening, suggesting that these temporary habitats can offer important resources during crop senescence. Parasitoid species composition differed between controls and unsown patches, indicating that species not linked to the crop could also benefit from these habitats. Finally, unsown patches with higher flower availability supported higher species richness, total abundance, and abundance of three key species during OSR flowering. Thus, newly created unmanaged habitats have the potential to increase biodiversity despite their small size, although increasing flower resources can boost their benefits. Unsown patches can be easily created by switching-off sowing, facilitating their adoption by farmers.

However, the use of field margin plants for biological control particularly of important common bean pests is understudied in smallholder farming systems of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We evaluated the potential of field margin plants with respect to intercropping systems in common bean fields to enhance the population of NEs of common bean pests. We observed a high assemblage of important NEs of common bean pests for some insect taxa with minimal impact of intercropping on NEs. Field margin plants could be managed to provide a wide range of resources to NEs and therefore biological control of common bean pests. Field margins support important ecosystem services including natural pest regulation. We investigated the influence of field margins on the spatial and temporal distribution of natural enemies (NEs) of bean pests in smallholder farming systems. We sampled NEs from high and low plant diversity bean fields using sweep netting and coloured sticky traps, comparing monocropped and intercropped farms. NEs collected from within crops included predatory bugs, lacewings, predatory flies, parasitic flies, parasitic wasps, lady beetles, and a range of other predatory beetles; with the most dominant group being parasitic wasps. Overall, high plant diversity fields had a higher number of NEs than low-diversity fields, regardless of sampling methods. The field margin had a significantly higher number of lacewings, parasitic wasps, predatory bugs, syrphid flies, and other predatory beetles relative to the crop, but beneficial insects were collected throughout the fields. However, we observed marginally higher populations of NEs in intercropping than in monocropping although the effect was not significant in both low and high plant diversity fields. We recommend smallholder farmers protect the field margins for the added benefit of natural pest regulation in their fields.","Aphis fabae [Biological control /  / ] [ /  / ] [Farming and agriculture and / Intercropping / biocontrol by natural enemies] [Coleopteran parasites and / Coccinellidae / ] [Dipteran parasites / Tachinidae / ] [Hymenopteran and parasites / Braconidae / ] [ / Ichneumonidae / ] [Plant hosts / and Phaseolus vulgaris / ] [ / Zea mays / ] [Insect predators / Asilidae and (Diptera) / ] [ / Carabidae (Coleoptera) / ] [ / Chrysopidae and (Neuroptera) / ] [ / Dolichopodidae (Diptera) / ] [ / Lycidae and (Coleoptera) / ] [ / Pentatomidae (Hemiptera) / ] [ / Reduviidae and (Hemiptera) / ] [ / Staphylinidae (Coleoptera) / ] [ / Syrphinae and (Diptera) / ] [Cultivated land habitat / Bean monocropped & intercropped and fields / ] [Tanzania / Kilimanjaro Region, Hai District, Kwa Sadala and Village / ]. and Asilidae; Carabidae; Chrysopidae; Dolichopodidae; Lycidae; Pentatomidae; and Reduviidae; Staphylinidae; Syrphinae [Biological control /  / ] [Insect and prey / Aphis fabae (Hemiptera) / ] [Life cycle / Life history / ] and [Species diversity /  / ] [Population size / Abundance / ] [Distribution and within habitat / Spatial & temporal distribution / ]. and Braconidae; Coccinellidae; Ichneumonidae; Tachinidae [Biological control and /  / ] [Hemipteran hosts / Aphis fabae / ] [Species diversity /  / ] and [Population size / Abundance / ] [Distribution within habitat / Spatial and & temporal distribution / ].",BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; HABITAT MANAGEMENT; INSECT ABUNDANCE; ENEMIES; and PESTS; BIODIVERSITY; HYMENOPTERA; POPULATION; ENHANCE; FOOD,INSECTS,13,7,NA,NA,Article,J,"Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science & Technology; University and of Greenwich; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew",Scopus,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,152,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There are indications that small mammal populations in Europe are declining due to the intensification of agriculture. According to national legislation, farmers in Switzerland have to cultivate at least 7% of their land as ecological compensation areas and, thus, some alternative habitats that are possibly beneficial for small mammals have been created. In this study, we estimated the diversity and density of small mammals on two types of conventional farmland field types (artificial grassland and autumn-sown wheat) and three types of ecological compensation areas (wild-flower strips, herbaceous strips and low-intensity meadows) by use of capture-recapture in March, May and July 2003. The common vole Microtus arvalis was the most abundant and predominant species in all habitat types except in herbaceous strips, which harboured the highest diversity with six species caught. In March the density of small mammals was generally very low, but significantly higher in wild-flower (mainly due to common vole) and herbaceous strips than in the other habitat types. In wild-flower and herbaceous strips, densities increased strongly from March to May and in July. On autumn-sown wheat fields, a strong increase occurred only from May to July and was caused by common vole. On artificial grassland and low-intensity meadows, densities of small mammals (mainly common vole) increased only marginally with low-intensity meadows supporting slightly higher densities. Thus, habitats that were not mown each year supported the highest densities of small mammals. This demonstrates that ecological compensation areas, such as wild-flower and herbaceous strips, make up an important refuge for small mammals.

Establishing flower strips along these margins is a well-established method of increasing biodiversity and promoting ecosystem services. Key knowledge gaps are related to interactions between seeded plants and existing weeds. We conducted a two-site field experiment in 2022 and 2023 in NY State, USA to test how seed mix composition (monocots plus dicots vs. dicots only) and seeding density (four rates) modify flower strip establishment under weedy conditions. Measurements included seedbank density and diversity, aboveground density and diversity, biomass, cover, canopy height, density of plants in the flowering stage, and abundance of bees, ladybeetles, and spiders. We found that weeds emerging from the soil seedbank hampered flower strip establishment at both sites. The aboveground density of seeded species was highest when monocots plus dicots were seeded at the highest tested rates. Although seeded plants occurred at lower densities than non-seeded plants, they were larger than non-seeded plants in 2023. Mean seeded plant size (g per individual) in September 2023 was 6??¨¬54 g and mean non-seeded plant size was below 1 g in all treatments. The number of seeded dicots in the flowering stage tended to increase with seeding rate in 2023. Flower strips affected bee abundance, especially in sweep-net samples from August 2023 (P = 0.01). At the Ithaca site, control treatments averaged 0.0??¨¬0.3 bees while flower strip treatments averaged 1.3??¨¬4.7 bees. Overall, these results highlight the potential for flower strips to enhance biodiversity even under weedy conditions. They also suggest that farmers seeking to establish flower strips in weedy fields should use high densities of competitive species. ?? 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Agricultural biodiversity; Beneficial arthropods; Ecosystem services; and Pollinator planting; Sustainable agriculture; Weed ecology,Ithaca [New York]; New York [United States]; United States; agricultural ecosystem; bee; beetle; biodiversity; canopy architecture; ecosystem service; flower; flowering; plant-pollinator interaction; spider,"AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT",374,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,Cornell University; Cornell University,Scopus,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,159,FALSE,Y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We specifically studied the effects of flower cover, grass cover, the ratio of perennials to annuals, plant species richness and extrafloral nectar on beneficial arthropod communities in vineyards. We used direct observation and net hunting to evaluate arthropod abundance. Sentinel cards with Lucilia sp. larvae were placed on grapevine plants to analyse caterpillar predation. We found that most groups of tested beneficial arthropods were positively influenced by flower cover and plant species richness. In particular, the abundance of predators such as ladybirds (adults and larvae) and crab spiders and the abundance of parasitic wasps were positively correlated to flower cover in vineyard inter-row vegetation. The abundance of ladybirds, hoverflies and crab spiders was also positively related to plant species richness.

Carabids only responded to the AES type and their communities had higher species richness in flowering fields. Spider species richness increased with landscape complexity. Community composition differed between AES types for all predator groups, with the composition of ground-dwelling spiders being additionally affected by landscape complexity. The mean body size of web-building spiders decreased with landscape complexity and the mean body size of female spiders was larger in flowering fields. 4. Both AES types can contribute to the conservation of predator communities. Species richness increased with non-productive AES. Agrobiont species occurred more frequently in productive AES. The overall number of exclusive predator species was lower in flowering fields. 5.

However, traditional fallow field borders lack nectar sources required to sustain beneficial insect communities, and their value to small mammals is not well-understood. In October-November 2009, we trapped small mammals in four field-border treatments (planted native, warm-season grasses and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, and frequently mowed vegetation) replicated around nine organic crop fields, and developed closed-population models in Program MARK to estimate abundance in each border.

No cotton rats were captured in mowed borders, and house mouse abundance was >= 5 times lower in mowed borders than in other border types. Lower abundance of cotton rats and house mice in mowed borders emphasizes the importance of structurally complex non-crop vegetation for supporting small-mammal communities in agricultural landscapes.

In the Netherlands, AEMs have been implemented by farmers' collectives since 2016, with the goal to improve the spatial targeting and coordination of measures, and thereby increase their effectiveness. The objective of this paper is to assess the effects of two AEMs, bird plots and field margins, on the abundance of seven cropland bird species targeted by the Dutch agri-environmental policy, and on their total abundance and species richness. The study was carried out in four farmers' collectives in the provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Flevoland in the Netherlands. We assessed how bird abundance and species richness measured on AEM plots and control plots were related to management and landscape factors. Furthermore, we assessed whether bird abundance and species richness measured on AEM plots were related to the spatial concentration of other AEM plots in landscapes surrounding AEM plots. With regard to plot management, we found a significant positive effect of field margins on skylarks, yellowhammers, common linnets, common kestrels, total bird abundance and species richness. Bird plots had a significant positive effect on skylarks and total bird abundance. However, western yellow wagtails, northern lapwings and Eurasian oystercatchers did not benefit from the two studied measures, likely because the vegetation in the bird plots and field margins is too high and dense for these species. Landscape factors, such as landscape openness, had contrasting effects on the analysed species, due to their different habitat requirements. Hence, there are no optimal landscapes for all target species, which underlines the need for a fine scale spatial targeting of measures based on species habitat requirements. Furthermore, the spatial concentration of other AEM plots in the landscape surrounding AEM plots had a significant effect for only two species (yellowhammer and western yellow wagtail), and this effect was negative. Thus, our results suggest that - for the studied species and landscapes - the type of measures and landscape in which they are taken are more important than their spatial concentration.",Agri-environment schemes; Farmers ' collectives; Arable field bird and species; Farming landscapes,SKYLARKS ALAUDA-ARVENSIS; WAGTAILS MOTACILLA-FLAVA; SOWN WILDFLOWER and STRIPS; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS; ABUNDANCE and DYNAMICS; VANELLUS-VANELLUS; FORAGING HABITAT; FARMLAND BIRDS; and MANAGEMENT,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,349,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,166,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this context, conservation biological control is a highly promising alternative, involving the cultivation or conservation of flowering plants within the agricultural ecosystem to attract and support natural enemies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of alyssum, Lobularia maritima (L.) Desv., in attracting natural enemies and managing pests in flue-cured tobacco cultivation. The study conducted two field experiments over successive years, each with of two treatments and three replicates, arranged in a completely randomized design. The treatments were (1) tobacco monoculture and (2) tobacco intercropped with alyssum flower strips. The population density of natural enemies and pests was monitored weekly throughout the study period. The results showed that the presence of alyssum flowers in the tobaccosalyssum treatment significantly increased the abundance of generalist predators such as syrphids, rove beetles, carabids, Orius sp. and spiders during both experiments. This increase in predator population led to a substantial reduction in tobacco pests, particularly aphids. Intercropping alyssum with tobacco can serve as an effective strategy for managing pests specific to the Nicotiana plant, as well as addressing the limited availability of approved insecticides for this crop.

Many beneficial groupswere attracted by ground cover treatments in comparison with control, showing an aggregative numerical response in the plots managed with some of the selected plant species. Alyssum, Buckwheat and 'Vetch and Oat' mixture showed attractiveness on some Hymenoptera parasitoid families, which represented 72.3% of the insects collected by sweeping net and 45.7 by vacuum sampling. Phytoseiidae mites showed a significant increase on leaves of the vineyard plots managed with ground covers, in comparison with control, although they did not show any difference among the treatments. In general, the tested ground cover treatments did not increase dangerous Homoptera populations in comparison with control, with the exception of Alyssum. The potential of ground cover plant management in Italian vineyards is discussed: the overall lack of potential negative effects of the plants tested, combined with an aggregative numerical response for many beneficials, seems to show a potential for their use in Northern Italy vineyards.",flowering plants; predators; parasitoids; functional biodiversity; and Phytoseiidae (Acarina),ENHANCE BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; NATURAL ENEMIES; ABUNDANCE; NECTAR; and COLEOPTERA; POLLEN; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY; SYRPHIDAE; VECTORS,BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,106,6,759,768,Article,J,University of Bologna,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,175,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hitherto, the main method used to manage these pests in Brazil has been the application of a limited number of registered insecticides. The search for more sustainable pest management strategies is therefore warranted. In this context, the conservation biological control stands out as an appealing alternative. Conservation biological control is achieved, at least in part, by strip-cultivating and/or conserving flowering plants within the agroecosystem. The present study investigates how alyssum flowers Lobularia maritima (L.) could contribute to the attraction of natural enemies and to the management of collard pests. Two field experiments were conducted in different years. Each experiment consisted of two treatments and three replicates, which were set up in a completely randomized design. The treatments were (1) collards alone, and (2) collards + alyssum. We evaluated weekly the population density of natural enemies and pests on both treatments. The results show that the alyssum flowers attractiveness contributed to increase the abundance of generalist predators during both experiments, which in turn translated into a significant reduction of collards pests, especially aphids. Some of the main predators attracted/harbored by alyssum flowers were spiders, coccinellids, syrphids and Orius sp. Finally, strip intercropping alyssum with collards can be an important strategy to manage brassica pests and cope with the limited availability of insecticides registered for this vegetable crop.",Arthropoda [Biological control /  / predation risk; intercropping plant and attraction] [Insect prey / Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera) / ] [ / and Brevicoryne brassicae (Hemiptera) / ] [ / Myzus persicae (Hemiptera) / ] and [ / Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera) / ] [Population density /  / ] and [Brazil / Goias / ]. and Bemisia tabaci [Biological control /  / Arthropod predators; predation and risk] [Parasites /  / ] [Plant hosts / Brassica oleracea / ] [Population and density /  / ] [Predators /  / ] [ / Arthropoda / ] [Brazil / Goias / ] and [ /  / ]. and Brevicoryne brassicae; Myzus persicae [Biological control /  / Arthropod and predators; predation risk] [ /  / ] [Parasites /  / ] [Insect parasites and /  / ] [Plant hosts / Brassica oleracea / ] [Population density /  / ] and [Predators /  / ] [ / Arthropoda / ] [Brazil / Goias / ] [ /  / ] [ /  / and ]. and Insecta [Biological control /  / intercropping plant attraction] and [Hemipteran hosts / Brevicoryne brassicae / ] [ / Myzus persicae / ] and [Population density /  / ] [Brazil / Goias / ]. and Plutella xylostella [Biological control /  / Arthropod predators; and predation risk] [ /  / ] [Food plants / Brassica oleracea / ] [Parasites and /  / ] [Population density /  / ] [Predators /  / ] [ / Arthropoda / ] and [Brazil / Goias / ].,NATURAL ENEMIES; APHID SUPPRESSION; APPLE ORCHARDS; INTRAGUILD and PREDATION; GENERALIST PREDATORS; HABITAT MANAGEMENT; FLORAL RESOURCES; and COVER CROPS; CONSERVATION; ABUNDANCE,BIOCONTROL (DORDRECHT),62,2,185,196,Article,J,Instituto Federal Goiano; Universidade Federal de Vicosa,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,176,FALSE,Y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In particular, we tested cabbage undersown with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and cabbage undersown with wheat plus additional sweet alyssum (Lobularia maritima L. Desv.) intercropping. Counts of the aphid species Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer), as well as related predators on cabbage plants, were determined. Abundance of Phyllotreta spp. flea beetles and their feeding damage on cabbage plants were recorded and cabbage yield was compared. In both countries, trials showed that wheat undersowing reduced the abundance of M. persicae but not B. brassicae. The occurrence of natural enemies on cabbage plants was not significantly affected by any of the companion plants. Additional sweet alyssum intercropping increased the abundance of adult hoverflies at the German but not at the Japanese location. However, it also significantly increased flea beetle infestation on cabbage plants at both locations. Neither wheat undersowing nor additional sweet alyssum intercropping significantly reduced cabbage harvest weight.In conclusion, adding companion plants can be a promising method to improve pest control in vegetable crops. However, intercropping crucifer crops with sweet alyssum may not be recommended in regions where flea beetles are a relevant pest because of the observed enhancing effect on them.

Introducing flowering plants into such greenhouses may promote the top-down pest suppression by natural enemies and reduce the reliance on pesticide use. However, it is not known how effective this practice is in organically and conventionally managed greenhouse crops. We assessed the influence of introducing flowering plants into open greenhouses with organically and conventionally managed tomato crops on the abundance of pests, natural enemies (NE), pollinators, and crop yield. We monitored tomato crops during two years in two greenhouses at four organic farms and four conventional farms that used integrated pest management (IPM). On each farm one greenhouse contained flower islands of basil (Ocimum bacilicum), marigold (Tagetes patula) and alyssum (Lobularia maritima), and the other greenhouse served as a control. Organic farms had yields comparable to conventional farms, a lower abundance of pests, less pest injury, and a higher abundance of NE. The cumulative pest: NE ratio was 9 for organic and 38 for conventional management. The effect of introducing flowering plants on arthropods depended significantly on the type of farm management. Conventionally managed tomato crops in greenhouses with seven flower islands per 100 m2 had 18% lower pest abundance compared to the control greenhouses without flowers, while flower islands did not significantly influence arthropod abundances in organically managed tomato crops. Tomato plants had a higher abundance of pests than the three introduced plant species in conventionally managed greenhouses, while marigold had a higher abundance of pests than tomato in organically managed greenhouses. Alyssum supported a relatively low pest abundance and high abundance of NE and pollinators. Our findings indicate that NE in IPM-conventionally managed greenhouses can benefit from resources provided by flowering plants, resulting in reduced pest abundance, while in organically managed greenhouses the conditions are already favourable for the suppression of pests and addition of floral resources does not further improve the effectiveness of NE.

Local management and landscape composition influence spider and prey communities and thereby their trophic interactions and functional role in arthropod food webs. We compared predator-prey interactions between organically managed cereal fields and sown flower-rich fields, both supported by agri-environmental schemes. The surrounding landscape of twelve study sites differed in the percentage of arable crops within a radius of 500 m around each site. We analyzed 1036 hand-collected web-building spiders with 5270 prey items from webs and 6777 potentially available prey items sampled by fenced suction sampling. Thysanoptera significantly dominated prey composition of web-building spiders in cereal fields located in landscapes with low percentages of arable crops, while Nematocera dominated prey composition in sown flower-rich fields. The captured prey numbers per spider web, irrespective of taxonomic identity, increased with the availability of potential prey, independent of habitat type or landscape composition. We did not find any effect on the compositions of web-building spiders and potential prey. Our results suggest that spider webs act as traps for prey that depend on prey density. However, this simple interpretation is only valid for the overall prey quantity, while capture success of single prey taxa may be habitat-specific and depend on landscape features. The impact of land use at different spatial scales on the functional role of web-building spiders should caution us towards density-based estimates of predation processes, e.g. when assessing the impact of agri-environmental schemes on arthropod food webs.

However, its production is limited by insect pests, notably the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae). The present field study was conducted to determine the difference in the contribution of lablab genotypes and natural field margin vegetation (FMV) to the abundance and diversity of natural enemies and the damage, incidence, and abundance of bean aphids. Eighteen lablab genotypes were planted in the presence or absence of FMV in a randomized complete block design experiment replicated four times. Data on aphid abundance, incidence, and severity of damage were collected at four growth stages of the crop. Lablab genotypes significantly influenced aphid incidence, suggesting some level of tolerance to aphid colonization. Findings showed that lablab genotypes were a significant influence on natural enemy species richness with no statistical difference for abundance and natural enemy species diversity. However, the genotypes did not vary significantly in their influence on the number of aphid natural enemies. FMV was associated with low bean aphid damage. Overall, the presence or absence of FMV did not influence the number of natural enemies caught on the crop. This concurs with recent work that shows a similar number of natural enemies with field margin plants but may reflect the reduced number of pest insects. Cropping seasons influenced aphid abundance and damage severity, with the populations developing at the early stages of lablab development and decreasing as the crop advanced. This pattern was similar both in the presence or absence of FMV. The findings of this study highlight the important contribution of crop genotype together with the presence of field margin species in the regulation of aphids and their natural enemies in lablab.

Here, we investigate whether aphid prey DNA can be detected in the gut contents of hoverfly larvae from a commercial strawberry field as a proof of concept that a molecular approach can be used to measure agricultural biocontrol. We used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to target insect DNA and compared the resulting data to reference databases containing aphid and hoverfly DNA sequences. We explored what impact incorporating wildflowers within polythene-clad tunnels may have on aphid DNA detection rates in hoverfly larvae. In a randomized block experiment, coriander (Coriandrum sativum), field forget-me-not (Myosotis arvensis) and corn mint (Mentha arvensis) plants were inserted in rows of strawberries. Their effect on aphid DNA detection rates was assessed. Aphid DNA was found in 55 of 149 specimens (37%) validating the method in principle for measuring agricultural services provided by hoverflies. Interestingly, detection rates were higher near plots with forget-me-not than plots with coriander, though detection rates in control plots did not differ significantly from either wildflower species. These findings confirm that hoverflies predate aphids in UK strawberry fields, and that HTS is a viable method of identifying aphid DNA in predatory hoverflies. We comment on the need for further method development to narrow down identifications of both predator and prey.

Britton (Lamiaceae) to assess their impact on the dynamics of species abundance, richness, and diversity of arthropod pests and their natural enemies over 2 years. Results showed that aromatic plants decreased the abundance of pest, with concomitant increases in predator (especially spiders and ladybirds) and parasitoid (Ichneumonidae spp.) abundance, creating a stable low abundance of pests in tea plantations.

However, the effects of aromatic plants are still unclear under field conditions. Here, we studied the potential of two aromatic plant species to promote codling moth natural enemies in a full factorial experiment. Ocimum basilicum increases codling moth parasitism. Tagetes patula has a general negative effect on both the codling moth and its natural enemies. We do not find a reduction in codling moth density or damaged apples on trees associated with aromatic plants. The addition of flowering companion plants within or around crop fields is a promising strategy to strengthen pest regulation by their natural enemies. Aromatic plants are frequently used as companion plants, but their effects on natural enemies remain unclear under field conditions. Here, we evaluated the effects of two aromatic plant species on the parasitism of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella) and the recruitment of predatory arthropods (spiders, earwigs) in a factorial field experiment. Apple trees were intercropped with basil (Ocimum basilicum), French marigolds (Tagetes patula), or ryegrass (Lolium perenne). The association between apple trees and O. basilicum increases codling moth parasitism, but does not affect arthropod predator abundances. Furthermore, we find a general negative effect of T. patula on arthropod diversities and abundances, including the pest and its natural enemies. Finally, changes in the parasitism rate and arthropod community structure due to the aromatic plants do not reduce codling moth density or associated apple damage. Further experiments are needed to determine the mechanisms involved in aromatic plant effects on pest repellence and on natural enemy recruitment (volatile organic compound composition, floral resource supply, or pest density dependence).",conservation biological control; companion plants; parasitism; apple and orchards,APHIS-CITRICOLA; APPLE; ORCHARDS; L.; BIODIVERSITY; CORIANDER; and LAMIACEAE; APHIDIDAE; RESPONSES; PREDATOR,INSECTS,13,10,NA,NA,Article,J,INRAE; Avignon Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Aix-Marseille and Universite,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,185,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, an experimental model of intercropping flowering plants in apple orchard was planned for two consecutive years to response above questions. Four flowering plants conserve a different number and proportions of six main predator species (three ladybeetles (Propylaea japonica, Harmonia axyridis and Hippo-damia variegata), one lacewing (Chrysoperla sinica), one hoverfly (Episyrphus balteatus) and one spider (Mis-umenops tricuspidatus)).

Transfer rate of predators H. axyridis from flowering plant C. monnieri to apple trees were 74.2 % and 80.1 % in 2020 and 2021, respectively.

The present study evaluates the effect of four different maize management regimes on pollinator diversity and community composition. Flowering plants intercropped with maize attracted pollinators, helping to support pollinator communities. Similar intercropping techniques using a grass ground cover did not increase pollinator density, demonstrating that pollinator richness, density and diversity is intrinsically linked to the presence of flowering plants. A maize system with a diverse intercrop may make it possible for pollinators to thrive; however, these systems may only be sufficiently attractive to bring pollinators in temporarily from the surrounding areas.

In a field-scale study, we quantified the effects of integrating the use of trap crops with insectary plants as a novel method to control pest herbivores in an organic cabbage agro-ecosystem. We hypothesized that pests would be concentrated in the trap crop habitat and suppressed by insectary-subsidized natural enemies in situ. We documented arthropod abundance (both adults and immature stages) associated with (1) two insectary plant species (sweet alyssum, Lobularia maritima, and buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum) either alone or in combination; (2) a trap crop mixture of mighty mustard (Brassica juncea), red Russian kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala), and glossy collards (Brassica oleracea var. italica), and (3) cabbage cash crop (Brassica oleracea var. capitata). Trap crops were more attractive to pests than the cash crop. On a per-plant basis, densities of the herbivores Evergestis rimosalis, Trichoplusia ni, and Plutella xylostella were 154, 37, and 161x greater on the kale trap crop than on the cabbage cash crop, and 54, 18, and 89x greater on the collards trap crop than on the cash crop. Insectary plants contributed to the consumption of pests that aggregated on the trap crop. Parasitism of E. rimosalis by the braconid wasp Cotesia orobenae was significantly increased, and the abundance of eggs and larvae of the predatory coccinellid beetle Coleomegilla maculata was greater on the trap crop in the presence of insectary plants compared to trap crops that lacked insectary plants.

In China, habitat management such as the in-field establishment of alfalfa strips is used for pest control in cotton. However, their effect on other economically important pests, such as the mirid bug Apolygus lucorum (Meyer-Dur), has not been evaluated. In this study, we first assessed parasitism of A. lucorum within plots of 13 different host plant species. Next, we established strips of one suitable plant species within a commercial cotton field and evaluated its effect on A. lucorum parasitism level. The results showed that two A. lucorum parasitoids, i.e., Peristenus spretus Chen et van Achterberg and Peristenus relictus Ruthe, responded differently to host plant species. In 2014, the parasitism levels of P. spretus were highest on buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum Moench, while parasitism levels of P. relictus were generally low and did not differ between the various plants. Furthermore, A. lucorum attained low population levels on buckwheat. In 2016, A. lucorum parasitism levels in buckwheat plots were higher than in cotton. When (2 m wide) buckwheat strips were established in cotton fields, P. spretus parasitism of A. lucorum on cotton plants increased 2.4-fold in 2016 and 8.5-fold in 2017 compared to cotton monocrops.

Habitat manipulation, a form of conservation biological control, is an ideal method of pest management for landscape systems. A field study was conducted to determine whether manipulating landscape habitats by adding flowering plants could reduce insect pest outbreaks. Incorporating flowering plants, coriander (Coriandrum sativum) and Shasta daisy (Chrysanthemum sp.), into a simulated landscape (plot) resulted in greater abundance of alternative prey and natural enemies. Survival of azalea lace bug (Stephanitis pyrioides (Scott)) on azaleas in plots with flowers was lower than in plots without flowers on most dates tested. Early season evaluation of azalea lace bug survival revealed no difference between plots with and without flowers. To determine whether the green lacewing predator, Chrysoperla carnea, could suppress azalea lace bug populations and whether flowers influenced the retention of green lacewings, augmentative release of lacewings was made onto azaleas with azalea lace bugs in plots with and without flowers. Lacewings reduced azalea lace bug populations in plots with and without flowers. Lacewings did not remain in plots with flowers any longer than in plots without flowers. High rates of lacewing disappearance from plots may be the result of dispersal, cannibalism, or intra-guild predation. This study suggests that augmentative release of green lacewings can effectively reduce azalea lace bug populations but these releases should be considered a short-term solution. Moreover, adding flowering plants to landscapes should reduce the likelihood of pest insect outbreaks.

Grey partridge is a farmland species which has experienced a significant decline across Europe in recent decades. Chick survival rate is a key determinant of grey partridge population change and depends essentially on the availability of insect food. In this study, ground-dwelling and canopy-dwelling insects were collected using pitfall trapping and sweep netting methodologies, respectively, on different strip types in an area established for the conservation of grey partridge. The aim was to further our understanding of the value of different vegetated strip types in providing insect-rich habitats for grey partridge chicks. Overall, wildflower strip (WS) provided the greatest insect abundance. Significantly more ground-dwelling insects were found on WS, natural regeneration (NS) and leguminous strips (LS) than on grass strip (GS). Canopy-dwelling insects were also significantly more abundant on WS compared to all other strip types.

Moreover, now it is known that the appropriate management of pollination can increase the quantity and quality of yields. Therefore, pollination appears to be a key component in modern agriculture. This study aimed to determine the impact of floral patch addition on the quality and quantity of Cucurbita maxima fruit production. To this end, we manually added a set of ornamental plant species to the edge of the crop and monitored the pollinator diversity and visit frequency, as well as the seed set and sugar content of the pumpkin yield, in treatment and control parcels. The results showed that there was a higher visit rate in the treated parcel. Only the sugar content, and not the seed set, was affected by the addition of ornamental species and the pollinator visit rate. These findings indicate that the addition of flowering plants can favor different components of the crop yield of this species, but future studies should sample on a broader spatial and temporal scale in order to certify the generalizability of our results.","Insecta [Foraging / Visit frequency / floral patches impact on yield and production; biodiversity] [Pollination / Cucurbita maxima / ] and [Cultivated land habitat / Orchard / ] [Chile / Buin, Alto Jahuel / ].",INSECT POLLINATORS; HONEY-BEES; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; L.; BUMBLEBEES; and EFFICIENCY; BOMBUS,DIVERSITY-BASEL,13,12,NA,NA,Article,J,Universidad Mayor; Universidad Mayor,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,NA,1,208,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
2185,"Wood, Thomas James",2017,The effect of agri-environment schemes on farmland bee populations,NA,"Over the past century there have been substantial declines in farmland biodiversity as a result of the intensification of agricultural practice. Concerns over these declines have led to the development of agri-environment schemes designed to mitigate the effects of intensive agriculture and to benefit biodiversity. Prior to commencing this thesis it was not clear if flower-rich, pollinator-focused agri-environment schemes had a population level impact on wild bees on farmland. Whilst previous work has shown that the creation of flower-rich habitat can provide suitable foraging resources for bumblebees, little was known about the impact of this management on bumblebee population sizes and even less on whether these resources were used by and benefited solitary bees. This thesis compares bee populations between farms with and without flower-rich, pollinator focused agri-environment schemes in Hampshire and West Sussex, UK. Using genetic techniques to estimate colony density, and hence population size, farms implementing targeted schemes had a significantly higher density of bumblebee nests for the four species studied (212 nests/km2 against 112 nests/km2). However, there was no difference in the species richness of bees between these different farm types. When assessing pollen use by solitary bees, flowering plants sown as part of pollinator-focused agri-environment schemes were not widely used, representing 27% of pollen foraging observations and 23% of pollen collected by volume. Only 35% of solitary bee species were found to use sown plants for pollen to a meaningful extent, with most pollen collected from plants persisting in the wider environment. The creation of flower-rich habitat significantly increased resource availability, but did not increase resource diversity. These results indicate that if diverse bee populations are to be maintained on farmland then agri-environment schemes must be developed that effectively increase the number of flowering plant species present at the farm scale.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Dissertation/Thesis,J,University of Sussex (United Kingdom),WoS,DT,NHM,grey,DT,FALSE,0,Thesis.,1,210,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the shrub-steppe ecosystem has diminished at an alarming rate due to extensive agricultural development fostered by access to an abundant water supply from the Cascade Mountains. This has resulted in loss and fragmentation of habitat for [approximately]50 species of butterflies which are now in decline. Viticulture is a major agricultural industry in south central Washington and has transitioned in recent years to a sustainable, low pesticide-input enterprise. Current viticultural pest management research is focused on restoration of shrub-steppe habitat and native plants to enhance and sustain beneficial arthropod populations (predators and parasitoids) for pest control. Butterfly populations were surveyed during 2012-13 in a pair of vineyards (habitat-enhanced, conventional) in each of four viticultural regions (Columbia gorge (CG), Walla Walla valley (WWV), Yakima valley (YV), Wahluke slope (WS)) in south-central Washington. The habitat-enhanced sites supported a significantly greater number of flowering plant species (mostly native) than conventional vineyard sites. Twenty nine butterfly species were recorded from the habitat-enhanced vineyards with only nine of these recorded from the conventional vineyards. Overall, there were double the number of species in habitat-enhanced vineyards (mean ([plus or minus]SE) 5.62 [plus or minus]A 0.85) compared to conventional vineyards (2.75 [plus or minus]A 0.75) although this was not statistically significant. A significantly greater number of species occurred in the CG and WWV habitat-enhanced vineyards (10.5 [plus or minus]A 0.5) compared to the conventional vineyards (3.5 [plus or minus]A 0.0) in these regions. Smaller numbers of butterfly species occurred in YV and WS vineyards with no significant differences between habitat-enhanced and conventional sites. Butterfly abundance was significantly greater in habitat-enhanced vineyards (20.37 [plus or minus]A 5.34 individuals/visit) compared to conventional vineyards (5.5 [plus or minus]A 0.9) with greatest differences in the CG and WWV vineyards. The pest management strategy of restoring native plants and habitats in a low pesticide-input crop like wine grapes in central Washington may have substantial benefits for butterfly abundance, diversity and conservation.

Ecological habitat management aims to regulate ecological functions, including ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination. My research has focused on the planting of wildflowers as habitat management for beneficial insects in allotments, gardens and vineyards, as intensively managed, lesser-studied landscapes. The estimated 400,000 ha of UK gardens provide considerable potential pollinator habitat, although a commonly perceived barrier to wildlife gardening is lack of space. Using citizen science, I investigated the effectiveness of a small 4 m2 wildflower patch in recruiting beneficial insects, allocating participants to one of three treatment groups (two wildflower mixes and control) who sampled insects in their private gardens and allotments. Small wildflower patches provided resource-rich habitats, with different treatments attracting different taxa. To assess the ability of a wildflower to attract pollinators to a crop and increase pollination services, I introduced bee-friendly borage as a companion plant co-located with a strawberry plant. In this citizen science project, I found that strawberries companion planted with borage produced significantly more fruit, and fruit of higher aesthetic quality. Verification of the results of both citizen science projects allowed the analysis of effective sampling methods and possible bias in projects conducted in private urban spaces. UK agri-environmental schemes have yet to make vineyard-specific recommendations to support biodiversity in viticulture, despite it being one of the fastest-growing sectors of English agriculture. By conducting insect and floral surveys in a British vineyard, I tested five inter-row treatments (three wildflower mixes, natural regeneration, and mown grass) on their potential in supporting beneficial insects. Sown and spontaneous wildflowers significantly increased insect abundance and richness, with no loss of space for grapevines. I engaged directly with British viticulturists through a survey to understand current management practices and barriers to adopting wildlife-friendly approaches. The majority of respondents reported reliance on synthetic pesticides, having grass-only inter-row cover and frequent summer mowing. Based on the findings in my thesis, I encourage the establishment, management and restoration of floral plantings in vineyards, gardens and allotments.

Rainforest transformation alters the diversity and composition of parasitoid wasp communities, but appropriate management strategies to buffer their decline in rainforest transformation landscapes are not yet developed. Here, we studied the effects of rainforest conversion to smallholder rubber and oil palm plantations on parasitoid wasp species richness, abundance and species composition. We also conducted a flowering vegetation enrichment experiment using the flowering weed Asystasia gangetica in all land-uses to investigate potential mitigation effects on parasitoid wasp diversity and composition. Rainforest transformation to rubber plantations caused a large decrease in species richness (46%) and abundance (59%) of parasitoid wasps. Community structure of parasitoid wasps differed between forest and monoculture habitats with more habitat-specialised species in forest and a higher proportion of common species in the monoculture. The experimental flowering vegetation enrichment increased parasitoid wasp species richness by 18% and abundance by 127%. Enrichment also enhanced the presence of unique parasitoid species in plantation and furthermore increased differences in community composition between rainforest and plantations. However, the enrichment experiment was confounded by time, meaning that a multi-year experiment with targeted controls is necessary for statistically more reliable statements. Our study shows the effect of rainforest transformation to oil palm and rubber plantations on parasitoid wasp communities. Although providing additional flowering vegetation in plantations seems to potentially mitigate diversity loss, further research is needed to confirm and to investigate the mechanisms how flowering plants alleviate negative effects of rainforest transformation on parasitoid communities.

Disentangling the relative impact of losses in plant species richness and intensified management on higher trophic level organisms is important for conservation recommendations. We established different management regimes along an experimental gradient of plant species richness within ""The Jena-Experiment"" in Germany and quantified herbivory as well as grasshoppers and pollinators. Herbivory, grasshopper density and species richness and frequency of flower visiting pollinators were recorded two times in each of four subplots of altogether 80 plots differing in plant species richness. Each of the four subplots was subject to four different levels of fertilizer application and mowing to simulate very low, low, high and very high land use intensity. Fertilization and mowing significantly affected plant-herbivore interactions but plant species richness had no discernible effect. Grasshoppers were most abundant at high intensity subplots (3.1 individuals per m2) and least abundant on very low intensity subplots (1.3 individuals per m2). Leaf damage caused by herbivores was highest in even the very high intensity subplots (3.7%) with four mowing events per year and high amounts of fertilizer application and lowest on subplots with a low management intensity (2.4%) comprising two mowing events per year but no fertilizer application. In contrast, pollinators benefited most from lower management intensities, with only one or two mowing events and no fertilizer addition. In addition, higher numbers of flowering plant species and increased blossom cover was associated with enhanced pollinator species richness and flower visitation. Our results indicate that even in grasslands with high plant species richness, mowing and fertilization are more important drivers of herbivory and flower visitation by pollinators. Management with no more than two cuts per year and without fertilizer application in our grasslands balanced the ecosystem functions of increased pollination and decreased herbivory.

The benefits of this approach are expected to differ between pollinator groups, because of fundamental differences in their ecology. We studied the responses of two pollinator groups, bumblebees and diurnal Lepidoptera (butterflies and diurnal moths), to the vegetation succession in experimental set-aside during six consecutive years. The pollinators were monitored in 24 large treatment plots (50¡Ì¨®50 m), sown with three different seed mixtures (competitive and two alternatives) and unmanaged or managed by mowing, and on 10 surrounding field margins. The responses of the two pollinator groups to vegetation succession were distinctly different. Bumblebees showed a very strong positive response to the diverse seed mixture with abundant floral resources, and their abundance peaked in the first year. The species richness and abundance of Lepidoptera were increased gradually, suggesting differential colonization speeds of species and a gradual establishment of populations. Lepidopteran abundance reached the level of the field margins in 3 years, whereas the corresponding species richness level was not reached. The benefits of the alternative seed mixtures were less pronounced in Lepidoptera than in bumblebees. No effects of the mowing treatment on either species group were detected. Within both pollinator groups, the response to vegetation succession was associated with species traits. In bumblebees, long-tongued species (indicating specialization) were increased during succession. In butterflies and diurnal moths, colonization success of species was strongly correlated with their wing span (indicating mobility). The most successful colonizers in butterflies were grass feeders and in diurnal moths the species feeding on leguminous plants at the larval stage. Synthesis and applications. The ecological requirements of different pollinator groups should be taken into account when establishing set-aside. Supporting bumblebees is possible even on short-term set-aside, assuming nectar and pollen sources are made available. The occurrence of butterflies and diurnal moths is strongly driven by additional factors, such as the availability of larval host plants as well as adult mobility, which calls for set-aside management regimes to be in place for several years.

However, only a few studies have evaluated whether these attempts are successful. We studied the effects of managing meadows according to the prescriptions of ecological compensation areas (ECA), the most widely adopted agri-environment scheme in Switzerland, on both pollinator species richness and abundance, and the reproductive success of plants in nearby intensively managed meadows (IM). We established arrays of four pots, each containing individuals of three insect-pollinated, non-autogamous 'phytometer' species (Raphanus sativus, Hypochaeris radicata and Campanula glomerata), in ECA and adjacent IM at increasing distances from the ECA at 13 sites. Species richness and abundance of hoverflies, solitary bees and large-sized pollinators (mainly social bees and butterflies) were significantly higher in ECA than in adjacent IM. Species richness and abundance of small-sized pollinators in IM declined significantly with increasing distance from ECA, whereas large-sized pollinators were not significantly affected by distance. Plant species richness and flower abundance were the major drivers of pollinator species richness and abundance; the area of an ECA had no significant influence. Individual plants of R. sativus and C. glomerata produced more and heavier seeds in ECA than in IM. Furthermore, the number of seeds of these two phytometer species was positively correlated with species richness and abundance of bees. No such effects were observed for individual plants of H. radicata. The number of fruits and seeds per plant of R. sativus in IM decreased with increasing distance from ECA.

At least 30 pollinator species were observed, the majority of which were common, generalist species. Pollinator biodiversity varied between solar parks and was explained by a combination of on-site floral resources and surrounding landscape characteristics. Floral species richness was the most influential on-site characteristic and woody linear feature density generally had a greater impact than the cover of surrounding high-quality habitats, although drivers differed by pollinator group.

Concerns at these declines have led to the development of flower-rich agri-environment schemes as a way to enhance bee diversity and abundance. Whilst the effect of these schemes on bumblebee species (Bombus spp.) has been well studied, their impact on the wider bee community is poorly understood. We used direct observations of foraging bees and pollen load analysis to quantify the relative contribution that sown flowers (i.e. those included in agri-environment scheme seed mixes) make to the pollen diets of wild solitary bees on Higher Level Stewardship farms (HLS) implementing pollinator-focused schemes and on Entry Level Stewardship farms (ELS) without such schemes in southern England, UK. HLS management significantly increased floral abundance, and as the abundance of sown flowers increased, these sown plants were utilized for pollen by a greater proportion of the solitary bee species present. However, the overall proportion of pollen collected from sown plants was low for both direct observations (27.0%) and pollen load analysis (23.3%). At most only 25 of the 72 observed species of solitary bee (34.7%) were recorded utilizing sown plants to a meaningful degree. The majority of solitary bee species did not collect pollen from flower species sown for pollinators. Total bee species richness was significantly associated with plant species richness, but there was no difference in the total species richness of either bee or flowering plant species between HLS and ELS farms. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the majority of solitary bee species present on farmland in the south-east of England collect most of their pollen from plants that persist unaided in the wider environment, and not from those included in agri-environment schemes focused on pollinators.

Nonetheless, few studies have so far investigated the effects of restoration practices on seed bank dynamics.

We assessed how these practices affected density and diversity of sown and unsown species in the seed bank. Seed bank dynamics were much more strongly affected by seed sowing than by cultivation. Grass sowing resulted in stronger seed bank decline of unsown grasses, and additional forb sowing in stronger decline of unsown forbs. Higher seed densities and species richness of sown forbs colonizing from neighboring plots sown with the grass¨Cforb mix were observed under natural regeneration than in the grass-only sown treatment, reflecting grass priority effects on sown forb colonization in the latter.

Most agri-environment agreements include several actions that the farmer agrees to put in place. But, most studies have only considered how individual agri-environmental actions affect particular ecosystem services. Thus, there is little understanding of how the range of agri-environmental actions available to a farmer might be deployed on any individual farm to enhance multiple services. To address this knowledge gap, we carried out an experimental study in which we deployed a set of agri-environmental actions on a commercial farm in southern England. Agri-environmental actions comprised wildflower margins and fallow areas in arable fields, creating and enhancing grassland with wildflowers, and digging ponds. Alongside biodiversity responses, we measured effects on a number of ecosystem services: pollination, pest control, crop and forage yield, water quality, climate regulation and cultural services. Wildflower margins enhanced invertebrates, pest control and crop yield, and aesthetic appeal. A greater number of pollinators was linked to enhanced oilseed rape yield. But these margins and the fallows did not prevent run-off of nutrients and sediment into waterways, and showed limited carbon sequestration or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Newly-dug ponds captured large amounts of sediment and provided aesthetic appeal. Grasslands had higher soil carbon content and microbial biomass, lower N20 emissions, and net sequestration of carbon compared to arable land. Enhancement of grassland plant diversity increased forage quality and aesthetic appeal. Visitors and residents valued a range of agri-environmental features and biodiversity across the farm. Our findings suggest one cannot necessarily expect any particular agri-environmental action will enhance all of a hoped-for set of ecosystem services in any particular setting.

Executive summary 1) Post-war agricultural intensification has resulted in the loss of habitats and species from the countryside. Conservation Grade is an industry-led assured produce scheme which aims to reverse these declines through the creation of carefully targeted wildlife habitat on land removed from agricultural production. 2) The aim of this project was to scientifically evaluate a range of core Conservation Grade habitats for enhancing wildlife and determine their optimum location in a typical farming situation. 3) In autumn 2006 an experiment was established on four arable fields of 5-6 ha each growing Conservation Grade oats on the Upton Estate, Warwickshire. 4) One of four habitat types (crop, natural regeneration, wild bird seed mix and wildflower seed mix) was established in the corner of each field using a latin-square design with four replicates. Identical habitats were established on the north- and south-facing field margins separating each corner using the same design. 5) The effect of habitat type and location was recorded on plants, flower resources, pollinating insects, other insects and birds using standard methodologies. 6) There were a large number of differences in the value of difference Conservation Grade habitats for wildlife over the 2 years. 7) Few species were found in the intensively managed cereal crop. 8) Allowing vegetation to regenerate naturally resulted in tall, competitive vegetation dominated by undesirable grass weeds and thistles. However, these were attractive to bumblebees. 9) The most effective treatments (wildflower and wild bird seed mix) were those specifically targeted to the requirements of declining wildlife groups. 10) Sowing an annual mix of seed-bearing crops was a very effective means of providing food resources for farmland birds during the winter. 11) Sowing a mixture of perennial wildflowers proved to be a reliable and rapid means of creating a diverse and weed-free vegetation community which was most attractive to bees, butterflies and other invertebrates. 12) Habitat location (margin or corner) had relatively few effects on abundance and diversity of wildlife after 2 years. However, habitat location may become more important as vegetation communities become established and colonised by species with more exacting habitat requirements.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Report,R,NA,NA,NORA,NA,grey,primary,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bird usage of winter food patches, comprising three different seed mixes, was monitored through the winter and was also related to seed yield. Winter and breeding season bird/territory abundance was recorded before and after the provision of the winter food patches. Bird use of the patches differed between seed mixes. There was large variation between individual patches in both seed yield and bird numbers and between individual bird species in their use of different seed mixes, suggesting that the availability of a range of patch types would be beneficial. Use of all patch types declined sharply in late January to February, indicating depletion and/or inability of birds to access shed seed. Winter bird abundance at a farm scale for all species combined, granivorous species and nine individual species increased for all monitored species when seed patches were available. At a treatment level, the increases tended to be greater in ELS-X, where most of the patches were located. In the breeding season at a farm scale, the numbers of territories for all species combined and granivorous species increased significantly when seed patches had been available in the previous winter. There was little evidence of a treatment-scale response.

First, most studies last < 4 years, which raises issues about whether diversity¨Cproductivity relationships are maintained in mature communities. Secondly, the conservation relevance of many studies is debatable. We addressed both issues using long-term experimental studies of the agriculturally relevant hay yield of recreated species-rich grasslands.
Grasslands were recreated within replicated experiments in ex-arable fields at two sites in southern England by using either species-poor or species-rich seed mixtures. The species-poor mixture comprised seven grasses as recommended for grassland creation in English agri-environment schemes. The species-rich mixture comprised 11 grasses and 28 forbs and was designed to recreate a typical southern English hay meadow.
After 8 years the plots sown with species-rich mixtures resembled target diverse community types. The plots sown with species-poor mixtures had been colonized by a number of forbs but had lower numbers of grasses, legumes and other forbs than the species-rich plots. Increased hay yield of the species-rich plots in the first years of the experiments have been described in an earlier paper, and these differences were maintained after 8 years.
In the eighth year the species-rich plots had an average 43% higher hay yield than the species-poor plots. Regression analysis showed that the variation in hay yield was related to differences in the number of non-leguminous forbs and showed no relation to grass or legume numbers. This suggests increased hay yield is an effect of the greater range of life forms exhibited by forbs rather than a simple fertilizing effect of legumes.
The nitrogen content and phosphorus content of the hay showed complex treatment effects over time. However, the nutritional value of the hay was above the minimum requirements for livestock.
Synthesis and applications. The aims of conservationists and farmers can often be in conflict.

Following recent agricultural intensification that led to a decrease in flower diversity and density in rural areas and subsequently to the decline of many insects, conservation measures targeted at pollinators have been established, including sown wildflower strips (WFS) along field margins. Historically successful in establishing a high density of generalist bees and increasing pollinator diversity, the impact of enhanced flower provision on wider ecological interactions and the structure of pollinator networks has been rarely investigated. Here, we tested the effects of increasing flower species richness and flower density in agricultural landscapes on bee-plant interaction networks. We measured plant species richness and flower density and surveyed honeybee and bumblebee visits on flowers across a range of field margins on 10 UK farms that applied different pollinator conservation measures. We found that both flower species richness and flower density significantly increased bee abundance, in early and late summer, respectively. At the network level, we found that higher flower species richness did not significantly alter bee species' generality indices, but significantly reduced network connectance and marginally reduced niche overlap across honeybees and bumblebee species, a proxy for insect competition. While higher connectance and niche overlap is believed to strengthen network robustness and often is the aim for the restoration of pollinator networks, we argue that carefully designed WFS may benefit bees by partitioning their foraging niche, limiting competition for resources and the potential for disease transmission via shared floral use. We also discuss the need to extend WFS and their positive effects into spring when wild bee populations are established.",NA,NA,Ecology and Evolution,12,10,e9442,NA,Article,J,NA,NA,NORA,NA,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One widely implemented response is 'wildlife-friendly farming', involving the close integration of conservation and extensive farming practices within agricultural landscapes.

Here, we show that new, evidence-based approaches to habitat creation on intensively managed farmland in England can achieve large increases in plant, bee and bird species. In particular, we found that habitat enhancement methods designed to provide the requirements of sensitive target biota consistently increased the richness and abundance of both rare and common species, with 10-fold to greater than 100-fold more rare species per sample area than generalized conventional conservation measures. Furthermore, targeting landscapes of high species richness amplified beneficial effects on the least mobile taxa: plants and bees.

A multi-site experiment was conducted on six arable farms in eastern England for 5 years to investigate the effectiveness of new agri-environment scheme options for conserving and enhancing a broad range of taxa and ecosystem functions; 2. The six treatments varied in the degree of management intervention from growing a cereal crop with restricted use of pesticide to complete removal of land from production and either allowing natural regeneration of vegetation or sowing seed mixtures which included: seed-bearing crops, tussocky grasses, pollen-and nectar-rich forbs, and fine-leaved-grasses and forbs. All treatments were compared with a conventional cereal crop control; 3. Residual soil fertility in the non-cropped field margins remained as high as the cropped land despite 5 years of cutting and removal of vegetation in the absence of fertiliser input. However, it was possible to establish and maintain a diverse mixture of wildflowers on this fertile soil and this resulted in a significant (25%) increase in soil carbon as measured by loss on ignition compared with the cropped treatments; 4. Diversity of plant species was highest in the sown wildflower margins and this was maintained throughout the study. However, annual cultivation of the field margin was the only treatment to promote the diversity of declining arable plants; 5. Bumblebee abundance was significantly higher (¡Á14) in margins sown with pollen- and nectar-rich species compared with all other treatments for the first 3 years only. Diversity of rare bees was also higher in this treatment. After year 3 there was a marked decline in the abundance bee forage plants and a corresponding increase in grass cover. Bee abundance and species richness was significantly higher in the wildflower margins compared with the other treatments throughout the experiment; 6. Butterfly abundance and diversity was highest in the wildflower, and pollen and nectar margins compared with the other treatments throughout the experiment; 7. Abundance and diversity of soil macro invertebrates was significantly higher in the non-cropped margin treatments sown with perennial seed mixtures compared with the cultivated treatments. Abundance of earthworms was 50% higher in these undisturbed, perennial margins; 8. Abundance of soil surface active detritivores was significantly higher in the non-crop margins compared with the cropped treatments in both autumn and spring. Seed predators were more abundant in the natural regeneration margins in the autumn. Richness and abundance of all invertebrates was significantly lower in the tussocky grass margins compared with all other treatments in the spring, probably reflecting lower activity; 9. Diversity of canopy-active invertebrates caught by both suction and sweep net sampling was significantly higher in the wildflower margins compared with all other treatments. Diversity was SID 5 (Rev. 3/06) Page 3 of 66 also higher in the other non-crop margins compared with the crop. Total abundance of invertebrates was higher in non-cropped margins compared with the crop treatments. This reflected a greater abundance and diversity of detritivores, herbivores and pollinating insects. In contrast, abundance of predatory (beneficial) invertebrates was significantly higher in the tussocky grass and wildflower margins; 10. Abundance of farmland bird indicator species in winter was significantly higher in the field centre patches sown with seed bearing crops compared with the adjacent crop. However, the magnitude of these differences declined considerably after the December visit each year as seed resources diminished. There was also evidence of a marked decline in the quality of this habitat after year 3; 11. Small mammal activity was significantly higher in the patches sown with wild bird seed mixture compared with the crop and field margin during the winter months. However, this pattern of utilisation was reversed in the summer; 12. Synthesis and applications: removal of land from arable production was a more practical and effective means of enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem functions than extensification of management practices. Creation of species-rich field margin vegetation resulted in significant beneficial effects for the widest range of taxa and functions both above- and below-ground. Management prescriptions specifically targeted to the requirements of declining taxa were generally more effective than those designed to deliver a broader range of environmental benefits.

A five y, farm-scale experiment was conducted to test the efficacy of England's Environmental Stewardship AES in enhancing the species richness and abundance of small mammals (voles Cricetidae, mice Muridae, and shrews Soricidae) in an intensively-farmed arable landscape.
Small mammal communities were sampled in spring and autumn on grassy field margins installed under the Entry Level Scheme (ELS) tier of Environmental Stewardship, where 1% of cropped land was converted to wildlife habitats. Results were compared with those from field margins on a second, experimental treatment (ELS Extra: ELSX) in which 5% of cropped land was taken out of production, and also field margins on a conventionally-farmed control treatment (¡®cross compliance¡¯: CC). Species richness and abundance of small mammals showed a significant increase on all treatments in spring and autumn. Many increases were greater on ELS and ELSX field margins compared to the CC controls, but there was little evidence that ELSX was more beneficial than ELS, and there were species-specific differences. Voles were not detected on any treatment in the initial sampling period but bank voles Myodes glareolus rapidly became abundant thereafter, particularly on ELS and ELSX field margins, and field voles Microtus agrestis also colonised. Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus were present on all treatments in all sampling periods, but spring abundance declined as vole abundance increased.

These include pollinating insects such as bumblebees, for which positive effects of AES on abundance and species richness have been shown. However, there is a lack of evidence for effects of AES on reproduction of target species, at either local or landscape scales. We conducted a large-scale study across landscapes exhibiting a gradient of agricultural intensity to investigate the effects of a targeted flower mixture, sown in patches of three different sizes, on an index of the total biomass of bumblebee sexuals (males and queens) on replicated transects within each landscape. We used this index (MQ) as a measure of bumblebee reproduction. After controlling for floral density on transects, we found that MQ was significantly higher on sown flower patches than on conventionally managed control patches at local scales throughout the three-year study. While sown flower patches did not significantly increase MQ in surrounding landscapes, MQ was higher in landscapes surrounding larger (1 ha) than smaller (0.25 ha) sown patches. Our results suggest that, while responses of different bee species may vary depending on the plant species sown, targeted flower mixtures can enhance bumblebee reproduction by providing locally attractive forage resources to bumblebees of all castes and sexes from nests within foraging distance. If established at large enough scales, sown flower patches may lead to a detectable spill-over of reproductives into surrounding landscapes. Furthermore, effects of sown patches on MQ were moderated by landscape context, the strongest positive responses being detected at sites with high proportions of arable land.

The results show that over a five year period (2006-2011) the effects on (i) habitat quality and food resources, and (ii) the abundance, diversity and population dynamics of some key farmland taxa were significantly enhanced by both targeted local management and enhancements at the landscape scale. However there were clear effects of scale on the responses of different taxa (see Table 1.1). Mobile species like bumblebees, moths, birds and small mammals were more subject to the effects of wider landscape context and showed a net response to the whole farm manipulation. The response of other taxa e.g. plants and some invertebrate groups, were more influenced by local environmental effects and plot level manipulations. In general resource quality was higher in the more ¡®targeted¡¯ ELSX options.

Critical to the success of any ELS agreement is the quality of plot establishment and maintenance.

Both ground conditions at establishment and subsequent weather conditions contributed to the high plot variability observed. We suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on creating a much higher proportion of field margin habitat that gives a higher probability of providing a range of critical both winter and summer resources for farmland wildlife.

To achieve this, we engaged with participants in Garden BirdWatch, a weekly garden wildlife recording scheme operated by the British Trust for Ornithology. Participants in the study provided data on the attributes of their garden and surrounding area and were asked to complete a questionnaire about their pesticide practices. Of the 417 gardens from which we obtained useful data, we found that 32.6 % had pesticides applied to. Urbanisation and garden quality were the main factors influencing insect populations. Butterfly richness was lower in suburban and urban gardens and butterfly abundance lower only in suburban gardens when compared to rural gardens, but this relationship did not hold for bumblebees. Abundance of butterflies and bumblebees, but not their species richness, increased with the habitat quality of gardens. Butterflies were lower in abundance and richness in more northerly gardens, which was not the case for bumblebees.

Developing a better understanding of the meadow characteristics driving human and wildlife response is therefore critical. We addressed this by assessing public and invertebrate response to eight different annual meadow mixes defined by two levels of plant species diversity and two levels of colour diversity, sown in an urban park in Luton, UK, in April 2015. On-site questionnaires with the visiting public were conducted in July, August and September 2015. Invertebrate responses were assessed via contemporaneous visual surveys and one sweep net survey (August 2015). Flower colour diversity had effects on human aesthetic response and the response of pollinators such as bumblebees and hoverflies. Plant species diversity, however, was not a driver of human response with evidence that people used colour diversity as a cue to assessing species diversity. Plant species diversity did affect some invertebrates, with higher abundances of certain taxa in low species diversity meadows. Our findings indicate that if the priority for sown meadows is to maximise human aesthetic enjoyment and the abundance and diversity of observable invertebrates, particularly pollinators, managers of urban green infrastructure should prioritise high flower colour diversity mixes over those of high plant species diversity.

Here we provide our perspective with an overview of several farm scale studies that have investigated the implementation of AES on arable farms. We suggest that the value of AES will be enhanced if they include a combination of field margins, winter bird seed plots and flowering hedges to provide wildlife habitat all year round. The data from these farm scale studies shows that at least 3-5% of the arable landscape should be uncropped and positively managed for biodiversity with targeted options (such as pollen and nectar mixes, winter bird food and flowering hedges).

The goals of this study were to quantify the amount of biocontrol service supplied to pumpkin fields and determine if this was affected by local habitat management or the surrounding landscape. Using sentinel eggs, we measured predation of squash bug, Anasa tristis, and spotted cucumber beetle, Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi, by generalist predators. We found that predators significantly removed D. undecimpunctata howardi but not A. tristis eggs. The guild of predators found to attack D. undecimpunctata howardi included Araneae, Carabidae, Cricetidae, Entomobryidae, Formicidae, Gryllidae and Opiliones. A smaller, but overlapping guild of predators was found to attack A. tristis, which included Araneae, Cricetidae, Formicidae and Gryllidae. Formicidae was consistently the dominate predator of both pest species. We examined how the addition of either a non-native annual plant insectary of sweet alyssum, Lobularia maritima, or a diverse insectary planted with native perennial forbs and grasses influenced predator abundance, composition, or biocontrol services relative to a grass control. We found no difference in either the predator community feeding on pest eggs or the proportion of eggs that they removed from adjacent pumpkin fields. Larger-scale landscape composition did influence the amount of egg predation occurring in pumpkin agroecosystems, however, these relationships varied among pests and across years of the study. Biological control is commonly predicted to increase with landscape diversity and the amount of non-crop habitat present surrounding focal fields, yet we found that when landscape did influence egg predation it was agricultural landscapes supporting the highest egg removal.

There were two treatments: in one treatment, weeds at the margins and inside the plots were regularly controlled by tillage; in the other treatment no weed control was done. Thrips and Orius were sampled by beating faba bean plants and weeds. Orius niger (Wolff) was the most abundant predatory insect species in faba bean and flowering weeds, with numbers of adults and nymphs significantly greater in plots with weedy margins than in weed-free plots. Flowering weeds did not contribute to the abundance of F. occidentalis on faba bean. Abundance of adults of Orius spp. did not coincide with the abundance of F. occidentalis on faba bean or weeds.

P. neoaphidis was able to infect the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, when maintained under controlled conditions that simulated those that occur seasonally in the UK. Although there was a significant inverse relationship between temperature and time-to-kill, with death occurring after 4.2, 6.9 and 13.6 days when maintained under fluctuating summer, autumn and winter temperatures, respectively, there were no additional statistically significant effects of photoperiod. The activity of inoculum on soil was indirectly assessed by baiting with A. pisum. Under controlled conditions P. neoaphidis remained active on soil and was able to infect aphids for up to 80 days. However, the percentage of aphids that became infected decreased from 76% on day 1 to 11% on day 80.

Insectary values were assigned to each wildflower based on length of flowering and relative attractiveness adjusted for background natural enemy activity. Wildflower species differed significantly in their ability to attract natural enemies, provide floral resources during the growing season, and maintain continued growth and flowering when contiguous with a perennial grass.

We studied Arion spp. and Deroceras reticulatum as major slug pests in Europe and beyond, and predatory carabids as their potential antagonists. Predatory carabids and slugs were sampled in 18 wheat fields bordered by different habitat types (arable fields, woody or herbaceous semi-natural vegetation) along a gradient of landscape composition (amount of semi-natural habitats in 1 km radius). Species richness of predatory carabids increased with the amount of semi-natural habitats in the landscapes around wheat fields. No effects of landscape composition or adjacent habitat type were observed for predatory carabid activity-density and Deroceras reticulatum. In contrast, Arion spp. had highest numbers in structurally poor landscapes, but only if fields were bordered by woody vegetation. Thus, Arion spp. thrived best in situations where predatory carabid species richness was lowest, indicating that carabids may contribute to the natural control of slug populations.

We found pronounced edge effects on most traits, and weaker effects of field size and AES in shaping functional traits. Smaller spiders, spiders with higher ballooning propensity and more web-builders were in the field interior than at the field edge, whereas carnivore carabids preferred field interiors. We also found a strong effect of landscape configuration, i.e. mean field size, as larger field size was positively related to more web-building spiders and more carnivore beetles.

Here, we evaluate the impact of creating flower-rich habitats in field margins on pollination, pest control, and crop yield over 3 years using a paired design across a landscape gradient.

These natural enemies of pest species often need a greater diversity of resources than the crops themselves provide. In intensive farm management the numbers of these beneficial arthropod species may be constrained by a lack of additional prey, floral resources or suitable overwintering sites. While previous studies have indicated that targeted field margin management can positively influence the population dynamics of beneficial insects, the relative contribution of the various resources provided by these targeted margins remains unclear.To help optimise field margins for conservation biological control, this study assessed the relative contribution of three key resources; aphid prey, floral resources, and grass overwintering sites, in supporting natural enemies of cereal aphids within an agricultural landscape. Trial plots were managed adjacent to wheat fields within agro-ecosystems in the UK to assess the relative importance of these three resources in isolation and in combination. The abundance of aphidophagous natural enemies was monitored with respect to these resources during two periods; prior to cereal aphid infestation in the crop, and during the infestation period. In addition, the abundance of cereal aphids and natural enemies was monitored in the crop next to the trial plots during the infestation period. The results show that resource needs of natural enemies vary both over time and between natural enemy groups. Some predators benefited from higher aphid abundance, particularly in combination with the availability of floral resources. Floral resources had the greatest individual effect in increasing natural enemy abundance, both prior to and during periods of aphid infestation. Grassy overwintering habitat provided little overall benefit during the two study periods.In the UK, most non-crop habitat in agro-ecosystems is grass dominated winter habitat. Few Stewardship scheme initiatives are designed to provide suitable floral resources targeting natural enemies of crop pests, or to provide suitable additional prey.

However, few studies address the interactions and trade-offs between biodiversity, multiple ecosystem services and crop production.We experimentally quantified the effect of uncultivated field margins, a prominent practice of ecological intensification, on agricultural production, biodiversity, as well as on multiple ecosystem services and disservices, in an intensive Mediterranean agro-ecosystem. We used a split-plot design and sampled butterflies, rodent and arthropod pests, arthropod natural enemies (both parasitoids and predators), weeds, damage to crop and crop yield in different distances into the field in 3 tomato and 11 wheat crops along the growing season.Field margins increased natural enemy densities, reduced pest-damage to crop and consequently increased yield in tomato crops. Notably, we found that pest control by one predator species was dominant in the field centre, whereas parasitoid natural enemies were confined to the field edges. Pest control was more prominent in the late crop-stage compared to early season sampling and field margins increased weed control in tomato crops by reducing weed cover.Field margins increased natural enemy densities in wheat at the beginning of the season, but effects on arthropod pests were inconsistent.

Promoting ecological intensification requires a holistic approach that considers the complex relationships among ecological and economic aspects of agro-ecosystems. We found that ecologically intensified field margins provided pest and weed control in the highly intensive tomato crop, yet they increased weed cover in wheat, which could potentially restrict yields at the field scale.

We assess how pest control of aphids on wheat (Rhopalosiphum padi) and pollinator linked yield gain in oilseed rape decline with distance from the crop edge. For natural pest control we also assess how field margin floristic diversity (simple grass vs. species-rich wildflower) affects pest control. We do not consider the impact of field margins on oilseed rape pollination as perennial dominated field margins are not in flower at the time of oilseed rape seed set and so do not act to attract pollinators. Aphid colonies exposed to invertebrate natural enemies went extinct at a faster rate than colonies where they were excluded. The rate of decline in per capita growth rates of aphid colonies was greatest when exposed to natural predators, with this effect being detected up to 50 m into the crop where species-rich field margins were present. While oilseed rape yield gains were correlated with pollinator (bees and flies) visitation rates, there was no evidence that yield gain declined with distance from the crop edge. Possibly this was due to honeybees showing no evidence of declining visitation rates with distance into the crop (over 200 m). This contrast with bumblebees, solitary bees and flies which showed evidence of declining visitation rates with distance from the crop edge.

In this study we quantified bumblebee abundance along hedgerow transects in MFC (field bean) vs non-MFC (wheat) margins. Surveys were conducted on east and west-facing margins twice daily (morning and afternoon) for three or four days during the main MFC flowering period (June) over four years involving paired bean and wheat fields in Devon and Cornwall, southwest England. Although no single bumblebee species showed any consistent change in relative frequency, when taken across all years and bumblebee species combined, we observed twice as many bumblebees visiting flowers adjacent to the MFC. However, when we compared bumblebee activity along hedgerow transects two weeks after bean flowering, there was no difference between crops. We thus conclude that although there is evidence for pollinator spill-over from the bean MFC to nearby semi-natural habitat, the effect is comparatively short lived and not specific to any single bumblebee species. We also suggest that while pollinator services to native plant species might be briefly enhanced by MFC cultivation, the possible repercussions of bumblebee spill-over from MFCs to semi-natural habitats and the other pollinator groups they support should be evaluated before MFC cultivation is considered as a means of conserving declining bumblebee populations.",NA,NA,Oikos,120,11,1618,1624,Article,J,NA,NA,snowballing_Donkersley2023,NA,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies evaluating effects of mitigation measures generally demonstrate positive responses of pollinators to floral resource enhancement. However, it remains unclear whether this represents landscape-level population effects or results from a spatial redistribution of individuals from otherwise unaffected populations.Here, we present a method for estimating landscape-level population effects using data from commonly used standardized pollinator transect surveys. The approach links local density responses of pollinators in both mitigation sites and surrounding landscape elements to the area these habitats occupy in mitigation landscapes as well as control landscapes to obtain landscape-level population estimates.We demonstrate the method using data from a 2-year study examining the effects of experimental wildflower enhancements on wild bumblebees and solitary bees in Dutch agricultural landscapes. The results show that conclusions based on local responses may differ significantly from those based on landscape-level responses.Wildflower enhancements significantly enhanced landscape-level abundance of both bumblebees and solitary bees. Bumblebees showed a pronounced positive local density response in mitigation sites and the surrounding landscape that was in line with significant landscape-level increases in abundance. However, solitary bees showed no local response to mitigation sites, and the landscape-level increases in abundance only became apparent when the area of bee habitat was taken into account.Incorporating the area of both newly created and pre-existing pollinator habitats into effect estimates accounts for density-dependent processes such as dilution, spillover and local concentration of individuals. It, therefore, results in more reliable estimates of the response to mitigation measures of pollinators, as well as other mobile arthropod groups that are often being surveyed using transect surveys.",NA,NA,Methods in Ecology and Evolution,9,7,1727,1738,Article,J,NA,NA,snowballing_Hyjazie2022,NA,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The role that ecological infrastructures such as hedges or strips have in enhancing functionally important groups, including predators, parasitoids and pollinators has been reasonably well investigated in temperate areas. However, it is much less documented in agroecosystems from the Mediterranean basin, even though this area has been identified as a biodiversity hotspot for conservation priorities. In a study developed during 2014 in a traditional vineyard agroecosystem in Northern Spain using a combination of different sampling methods, we analysed beneficial arthropod assemblages across four types of linear ecological infrastructures: woodland hedges, rosaceous hedges, grass strips and flower strips. We investigated the value of these elements as a source of predators, parasitoids and pollinators. We show that ecological infrastructures across this Mediterranean vineyard agroecosystem support functionally important groups and that the abundance, richness and distribution of families of each functional group is determined by features characterising the different types of those infrastructures. Ecological infrastructures with a suitable level of structural diversity constitute an important reservoir of predators. On the other hand, parasitoids and pollinators were limited by the availability of hosts, pollen and nectar resources. Flower strips, less complex infrastructures that offer a high amount of floral resources, benefited communities of both parasitoids and pollinators.

Forage patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist.

Nonetheless, this conceptually-simple approach often fails to reduce pest numbers. We examined whether flowering annual plants drew more natural enemies to apples (Malus domestica) in Washington State, USA, and in turn whether this improved suppression of woolly apple aphids (Eriosoma lanigerum) on nearby trees. Initial screening of candidate flowers indicated that syrphid flies (Diptera: Syrphidae), thought to be important aphid predators, were particularly attracted to sweet alyssum flowers (Lobularia maritima). Therefore, in two subsequent field experiments we compared aphid densities on trees placed adjacent to, or relatively far from, flowering sweet alyssum. The results were striking: after one week aphid densities were significantly lower on trees adjacent to flowers than on those on control plots, and these differences were maintained for several weeks. It was unlikely that aphid decline was primarily due to syrphid predation, because lower aphid densities were observed despite few syrphid larvae being present. Rather, a diverse group of generalist-predator spiders and bugs increased significantly near sweet alyssum plantings, and may have been responsible for much of the aphid suppression that we observed. Immunomarking revealed that natural enemies regularly moved from sweet alyssum to the surrounding orchard.

Therefore, planting/growing insectary plants in the margins of orchards should be considered as an alternative approach.

Recent advances in our understanding of flower strips in agricultural systems suggest that the management of the tree row understorey could be an important contributor to this variation. Here, we compare two cutting regimes for an understorey, originally seeded with the same flower mix, in the tree rows of an apple-arable agroforestry system: (i) uncut vegetation to promote a flowering understorey, and (ii) regularly mown vegetation. We recorded the effects of management on invertebrate pests, natural enemies, and pollinators, in both the apple and arable components. Apple trees above flowering understoreys supported significantly: (i) more natural enemies early in the season, (ii) fewer aphid colonies, (iii) fewer aphid-damaged fruits, and (iv) higher pollinator visitation, compared with those above mown understoreys. In the arable crop alleys, both the taxonomic richness and Shannon diversity of ground-based natural enemies were significantly higher adjacent to flowering understoreys, compared with those adjacent to mown understoreys, early in the season.

To date, it is poorly understood how WFS promote flower visitation and pollination services in nearby insect-pollinated crops. We therefore ask whether WFS enhance pollination service in adjacent strawberry crops, and how such an effect depends on the distance from WFS. Over 2 years, we examined the effects of experimentally sown WFS compared to grassy strips on pollination services in adjacent strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) crops across a total of 19 study sites. Moreover, we examined flower visitation, species richness and community composition of the most important insect pollinator taxa at different within-field locations varying in distance to WFS. We found increased pollination services at the edge of WFS compared to locally reduced pollination services at the center, which resulted in no significant difference in seed set between WFS and control fields. Total flower visits and species richness of pollinators were higher in WFS than in adjacent strawberry fields. Moreover, wild bee visitation was enhanced in adjacent strawberry crops near WFS compared to field centers, and intermediate at field edges near grassy strips. Our study demonstrates that diverse WFS can increase wild bee visitation and pollination services in the field edges of adjacent strawberry crops, but that overall visitation and pollination services do not increase. Moreover, our findings show that major pollinator taxa exhibit distinct responses, resulting in a shift of pollinator community composition as a function of distance to WFS with direct effects on crop pollination.

At 19 sites, we surveyed the road verge (verge edge and verge centre), the verge hedge (both sides), a field hedge and the field interior.Road verges and hedges had a much greater flower abundance, flower species richness and pollinator abundance than field interiors.

Rich pollinator assemblages are documented in some cities despite habitat fragmentation and degradation, suggesting that urban areas have potential as pollinator refuges. To inform urban bee conservation, we assessed local- and landscape-scale drivers of bee community composition and foraging within vacant lots of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Cleveland is a shrinking city, a type of urban area that has an over-abundance of vacated greenspaces as a result of population loss and subsequent demolition of abandoned infrastructure. As such, Cleveland represents over 350 post-industrial cities worldwide that are all promising locations for bee conservation. 2. Across a network of 56 residential vacant lots (each similar to 30 m x 12 m), we established seven unique habitats, including seeded native prairies, to investigate how vegetation management and landscape context at a 1,500 m radius influenced urban bee communities. We assessed the distribution of several bee functional traits, diversity and abundance with pan and malaise traps. Foraging frequency was determined with plant-pollinator interaction networks derived from vacuum collections of bees at flowers. 3. We observed higher bee richness and increased abundance of smaller sized bees as the size of surrounding greenspace patches increased within a 1,500 m radius landscape buffer. Within habitats, seeded treatments had no effect on bees but greater plant biomass and shorter vegetation were correlated with increased bee richness and abundance. Plant-pollinator interaction networks were dominated by spontaneous non-native vegetation, illustrating that this forage supports urban bees. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that proximity to larger greenspaces within an urban landscape promotes overall bee richness and increased occurrence of smaller bee species within residential vacant lots. While we did not observe our seeded native plants enhancing the bee community, native wildflowers were still establishing during the study and may have a greater influence when blooming at higher densities. Importantly, spontaneous non-native vegetation provided the majority of urban bee's forage. Thus, vacant land that is minimally managed and vegetated with what many consider undesirable 'weeds' provides valuable habitat for bee conservation in cities.",bee foraging; native prairie; patch area; plant-pollinator interaction; and shrinking city; spontaneous vegetation; urban greenspace; urban and landscapes,HYMENOPTERA; DIVERSITY; SPACE; BIODIVERSITY; POLLINATORS; REVISION,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,58,1,58,69,Article,J,University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of and Ohio; Ohio State University,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,Ruby has already extracted data,1,194,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, as a major part of urban green space, roadside vegetation permeates the urban fabric and, if enhanced, can be used to support insects, such as wild bees. To analyze local and landscape-scale effects of enhanced urban roadsides on wild bee communities and to identify bee traits affected by urban filtering, we established 78 wildflower patches with a native seed mixture along five major roads in Munich (S Germany). Species-poor roadsides with regular management were used as control. During a three-year experiment, we sampled wild bees with pan traps, monitored roadside vegetation, and analyzed landscape diversity and perimeter-area ratio of green space within a radius of 500 m. We gathered information on wild bee morphological, behavioral, phenological, and foraging traits and calculated their abundance, species richness and functional dispersion. Wild bee abundance, richness and functional dispersion increased with vegetation diversity. Functional dispersion was positively correlated with landscape diversity and distance from the city center, indicating trait-based urban filtering. A fourth corner analysis revealed that small, short-lived, and univoltine bees were disadvantaged at urban roadsides. While univoltine bees were discriminated in areas of high landscape diversity, large bees prevailed in the city outskirts, and solitary bees were associated with green space edges. We conclude that enhanced roadsides contribute to urban wild bee diversity and that identifying functional groups affected by urbanization can help to draw recommendations for effective conservation.","Apoidea [Disturbance by man / Urbanization / ] [Conservation /  / ] and [Food plants /  / ] [Pollination /  / ] [Community structure /  / ] and [Population dynamics / Population abundance / ] [Roadside habitat / Road and verge habitat / ] [Spatial environment / Landscape scale / ] [Germany / and Bavaria, Munich / ].",FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; FRAMEWORK; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; and RESTORATION; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,291,NA,NA,NA,Article,J,Technical University of Munich,WoS,CC,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,Ruby has already extracted data,1,202,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We also evaluate the overall use of native and introduced flowers by these insect groups in the urban garden study sites. 3. Bayesian analyses failed to find a strong influence of the native plant additions on beneficial insect richness, after correcting for prior floral abundance. 4. In addition, butterflies and megachilid (leaf-cutter) bees were found to heavily utilise introduced ornamental and crop flowers in these gardens, even when native flowers were present. 5.

Urban greenspaces have the capacity to preserve pollinator biodiversity, but the quality of support they provide depends on greenspace landscape attributes, including the availability of pollinator habitat and foraging resources. Wild native bees provide important pollination services to urban ecosystems, yet relatively little is known about how urban landscape management influences pollinator community composition and diversity. Our study explores how wild bee communities are affected by greenspace and landscape-level features like pollinator management practices, in urban greenspaces in and around Appleton Wisconsin: a mid-sized urban community spanning more than 100 sq. km. We sampled and identified native bees periodically between late-May 2017 and mid-September of 2018 using standardized arrays of pan traps at 15 sites around the city. We classified greenspaces based on their level of development (urban or suburban) and whether they were managed or unmanaged for increasing wild pollinator diversity. We quantified floral species diversity, floral color diversity, tree species diversity, and proximity of sites to open water for each site and used remotely sensed satellite data from both the USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). All variables were tested as potential correlates of wild bee abundance and species richness. Active pollinator management sites supported higher levels of bee abundance and richness. Notably, active greenspace management (e.g. planting native wildflowers) was a stronger correlate of bee abundance and richness than greenspace size and other landscape-level attributes. Within-greenspace attributes such as floral diversity, tree diversity, and proximity to open water contributed positively to both bee abundance and richness. Based on these findings, we suggest that urban greenspaces may be managed more efficiently and cost-effectively by focusing resources on active management by planting wildflowers, removing invasive species, creating nesting habitat, and providing water resources, rather than simply expanding in area.",Apoidea [Disturbance by man / Urbanization / ] [Food plants /  / ] and [Foraging / Floral visitation / ] [Pollination /  / ] [Community and structure / Biodiversity / ] [Urban habitat / Urban greenspaces / ] and [Wisconsin / Appleton / ].,BOMBUS SPP.

To test the effectiveness of small-scale floral additions on enhancing urban bee populations, as well as their impact from 1??year to the next, different quantities of potted sweet alyssum (Lobularia maritima) flowers were placed across sites in Ann Arbor, Michigan for two consecutive years and the resulting Halictid bee visitors were monitored. Overall, we found the number of flowers added at the local level was significantly and positively correlated with small Halictid bee abundance and species density in an urban landscape. At smaller flower quantities, dynamics were clearly linear, where incremental increases in number of flowers showed significant increases in bee abundance and species density. At larger quantities of floral additions, however, dynamics were nonlinear in that incremental increases in flower quantity had no effect on bee abundance and highly variable effects on bee species density. When comparing the change in small Halictid bee abundance and species density from 1??year to the next, we found a significant increase in bee species density in the second year of small-scale floral additions, but no significant difference in bee abundance. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that small flower plantings can have positive effects on small bee communities in urban systems even over a short period of time and therefore confirm that encouraging citizens to plant flowers can be an effective conservation strategy for certain urban pollinator populations. In addition, our finding that smaller flower plantings may have higher impacts on small pollinators than larger plantings suggests resource managers interested in pollinator conservation should consider spreading multiple, smaller floral plantings across the urban landscape, rather than pooling all resources into one large flower patch. ?? 2017 The Authors.

The effects of fallow strips on biological control of bird cherry-oat aphids in spring barley were examined in a field experiment in Finland in 2014-2016. Two types of sown perennial fallow strips - grass strip and wildflower strip - were compared. The relative efficiency of biological pest control was tested by monitoring the number of experimentally added aphids in the fallow strips and in the adjacent barley fields at different distances from the strips. Data were also collected on the densities of naturally occurring aphids and ground-dwelling natural enemies. The effects of the fallow strips differed between years. When aphid pressure was high, the proximity of the strips slowed the growth of aphid population. In the year of low aphid abundance, the fallow strips sustained more aphids than the adjacent barley fields, but did not constitute a risk for pest control. In the second and third years, especially wildflower strips supported high activity density of ground-dwelling predators. The activity densities were particularly high in the both fallow strip types in early summer, highlighting the role of the perennial strips as refuges for natural enemies.

However, bee populations are at risk from stressors such as habitat loss, pesticides, and disease. On-farm wildflower plantings is one mitigation strategy to provide habitat and resources for bees. In many instances, government programs can subsidize the installation of these plantings for private landowners. Semi-natural habitat (SNH) in the landscape is also important for bee conservation and may alter the effectiveness of wildflower plantings. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of wildflower plantings and interactions with SNH in the landscape for promoting bee abundance and richness. Bee surveys were conducted over 2 yr at 22 sites in eastern Virginia and Maryland. Wildflower plantings, averaging 0.22 ha in size, were installed and maintained by cooperators at 10 of the sites. In total, 5,122 bees were identified from 85 species. Wildflower plantings did not alter bee communities independently, but bee abundance was greater on farms with plantings and 20-30% SNH in the landscape. Bee abundance and richness had nonlinear responses to increasing SNH in the landscape. The positive effects for richness and abundance peaked when SNH was approximately 40% of the landscape. Similar to predictions of the intermediate-landscape complexity hypothesis, increases in bee abundance at wildflower sites were only detected in simplified landscapes. Results indicate that small wildflower plantings in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. only provided conservation benefits to bee communities under specific circumstances on the scale studied, and that conserving SNH across the landscape may be a more important strategy.",Andrenidae; Apidae; Colletidae; Halictidae; Megachilidae [Conservation and measures / Conservation benefits / ] [Pollination / Wild flower plants / and ] [Community structure /  / ] [Population dynamics / Abundance / ] and [Maryland / Delmarva Peninsula / ] [Virginia / Delmarva Peninsula & and Virginia Beach / ].,NA,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,50,4,NA,NA,Article,J,NA,WoS,ZR,UoR,peerreviewed,primary,FALSE,0,Exclude.

The abundance of juvenile short-winged beetles and spiders as well as the species richness of adult short-winged beetles and spiders were significantly higher on the experimental plots (WBF) than on surrounding agricultural areas. After the first sowing of the WBF in 2016, the median breeding pair density of grey partridges in the trial areas increased by a factor of three during the trial period. The number of observed partridges per family (median mean chain size) in the trial period (2016 2019) was higher in trial areas (JBZ with WBF) than in reference areas (JBZ without WBF). The share of WBF in the total area of the ""experimental areas"" during the project was relatively low and increased from 0.0 % (2015) during the project period to 2.6 % in 2019. The positive population development of studied insect guilds (ground beetles, short-winged beetles) in the trial areas illustrate the effectiveness of perennial flowering areas (wild plants from autochthonous seeds ""Regiosaatgut"") on the food chain of partridges due to the high abundance and the broader species spectrum. The effects of sown flowering areas on the development of ground-dwelling arthropods as indispensable food for partridge chicks in the first days of life and thus indirectly also on partridges were most effective in simply structured landscapes with 4 %-6 % of existing, permanent near-natural habitats and at least 6-8 % of transient flowering areas. Therefore, simply structured landscapes are the central field of action for future measures to improve the ecological endowment by means of transient semi-natural structures, such as wild plant flowering areas in particular. The results and effects achieved at the local level of perennial wild plant-flowering mixtures (Regiosaat) with low proportions of cultivated plants therefore describe a possibility to stabilise partridge populations by promoting insects and wild plants on agricultural land.
