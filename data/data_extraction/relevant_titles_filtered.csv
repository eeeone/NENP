596,"The potential for wildflower interventions to enhance natural enemies and pollinators in commercial apple orchards is limited by other management practices","Modern fruit production has successfully increased yields and fruit quality to meet market demands mainly through intensification and the use of Plant Protection Products (PPPs). Due to the associated environmental impacts and consumers increasingly demanding food produced more sustainably, the tree fruit sector is seeking to reduce its reliance on PPPs. Despite intensification, apple production is still highly dependent on ecosystem services, including pest regulation and pollination. The aim of this study was to investigate the response of natural enemies and pollinators in commercial apple orchards to the provision of a wildflower habitat. It was hypothesised that the abundance and diversity of beneficial invertebrate species would be enhanced leading to an increased control of apple pests and enhanced pollination of apple blossom. We also investigated the effect of orchard pesticide toxicity on natural enemies and pest regulation services and how responses varied between apple cultivars (Jazz and Braeburn). The study was carried out in five orchards of each apple variety across Kent (UK), using a split-plot experimental design. At each site, a one-hectare orchard plot was established with wildflower strips in alleyways between rows of trees and compared with a one-hectare control plot where alleyways were managed conventionally with regular cuffing. Responses of natural enemies and pollinators were recorded over a period of three and four years, respectively. The presence of wildflower strips did not contribute significantly towards the delivery of natural pest regulation or pollination services. However, hoverfly diversity and species richness were greater in orchards with wildflower strips, and whilst this was not associated with increased rates of pest regulation, such a response could potentially provide more resilient pest regulation and pollination services. Braeburn orchards had higher bee abundance, and pest predation rates, which were associated with a greater abundance of earwigs, compared to Jazz orchards. Of key significance for growers is that high values of cumulative pesticide toxicity negatively affected natural enemy populations, especially earwigs. If growers want to support natural enemies and wild pollinators in modern apple orchards following the principles of ecological intensification, they need to consider both the types and frequency of pesticide sprays used, in conjunction with interventions aimed at promoting beneficial invertebrates.","10.1016/j.agee.2020.107034","McKerchar, M. and Potts, S.G. and Fountain, M.T. and Garratt, M.P.D. and Westbury, D.B.

795,"The impact of wildflower habitat on insect functional group abundance in turfgrass systems","Simple Summary Turfgrass is a prevalent ground cover type within urban areas, and is found on large swathes of commercial, residential, and recreational land. Turfgrass supports low biodiversity compared with more diverse vegetation communities. One increasingly popular method for supporting arthropod communities in urban areas is to plant wildflowers in available spaces using a commercial seed mix, which can support beneficial insects such as butterflies, bees, and natural enemies. However, the long-term impacts of these wildflower habitats on arthropod communities in turfgrass systems is poorly known. To explore this, we used pan traps to sample insects from turfgrass systems adjacent to wildflower plots over three years and quantified how different insect groups changed in abundance. We found that different insect groups had variable changes in abundance over time, with sweat bees (Halicitdae) and skipper butterflies (Hesperiidae) being less abundant two years after wildlife implementation, and predatory flies showing boosted abundance for two years post-implementation. These results point to the complex dynamics of arthropod communities in turfgrass systems following wildflower implementation and the need to study how to best maintain these habitats to support long-term biodiversity.Abstract Urbanization is rapidly influencing the abundance and diversity of arthropods. Within urban systems, managed turfgrass is a prominent land cover which can support only a limited number of arthropod groups. To allow for more arthropod biodiversity and to support beneficial insects within turfgrass, increasing numbers of land managers are choosing to partially convert turf habitat to wildflower habitat using commercially available seed mixes. However, the population dynamics of arthropod groups in these systems are poorly known, with consequentially little information on best long-term practices for managing wildflower habitats in turfgrass systems. To address this gap, we sampled insects using pan traps in turfgrass systems pre- and post-implementation of wildflower habitats and examined the change in abundance of several insect families and functional guilds. Insect groups had variable responses to wildflower habitat implementation, with some groups such as sweat bees and skipper butterflies showing a decline two years post-implementation. Other groups, such as predatory flies, were relatively more abundant one and two years post-implementation.

1268,"Enhanced urban roadside vegetation increases pollinator abundance whereas landscape characteristics drive pollination","Roads cause pollution, habitat degradation and fragmentation, while recent studies report that roadside vege-tation can benefit plant and insect diversity. However, the factors that drive effects of roadside vegetation on pollinator abundance and pollination need further attention. Our main interest in this study was to evaluate urban roadside enhancement by identifying direct and indirect effects of local resource availability and land-scape characteristics on pollinator abundance and quality of pollination, by using functionally different phy-tometer plants. Thus, we established 34 species-rich wildflower patches along urban roads, and monitored flowering species and floral density at the local scale. At the landscape scale we measured the amount of impervious surface within a radius of 500 m around the wildflower patches, as well as edge density of all major land-use types, and distance to the city center. As control, we used 34 patches with existing species-poor roadside green. The abundance of pollinators, i.e., honeybees, wild bees, and hoverflies, was sampled with colored pan traps. Pollination was monitored based on fruit number and weight of three phytometer species, i.e., Fragaria x ananassa, Ranunculus acris, and Trifolium pratense, that differ in flower morphology and color, and attract different pollinators. Pollinator abundance was positively related to local richness of flowering plants and floral density. At the landscape scale, pollinator abundance was positively related to the proportion of impervious surface but negatively to edge density. Phytometer-specific effects on pollination were moderated by landscape characteristics: Fruit mass of F. x. ananassa was highest in the inner city, fruit number of R. acris was lower in areas with high edge density, whereas in T. pratense fruit number increased with edge density, and was nega-tively related with the proportion of impervious surface. There were no indirect effects of local and landscape factors via pollinator abundance on pollination. The study of the three phytometer species revealed that roadside enhancement can directly support fruit production in wild plants and crops in cities. Thereby, different landscape characteristics influenced the quality of fruit set, which also depended on individual plant reproductive adap-tations. This stresses the importance of using a set of complementary phytometer species in pollination experi-ments, especially to gain insights into ecosystem functioning at coarser spatial scales.","10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109980","Dietzel, Simon (simon.dietzel@tum.de) and Rojas-Botero, Sandra and Kollmann, Johannes and Fischer, Christina",2023,"ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS","Enhanced urban roadside vegetation increases pollinator abundance whereas landscape characteristics drive pollination Roads cause pollution, habitat degradation and fragmentation, while recent studies report that roadside vege-tation can benefit plant and insect diversity.

2591,"Pollination service delivery is complex: urban garden crop yields are best explained by local canopy cover and garden scale plant species richness","Pollination is an important ecosystem service to agriculture, however, the factors influencing pollination in urban food gardens are poorly understood. We investigated how features within urban environments, including floral resources and canopy cover, impacted (a) flower visitation and seed production of a model plant (Brassica rapa) and (b) total yields of produce from urban gardens in Sydney, Australia. Floral visitation to model plants was dominated by a few common species, with honeybees responsible for 53.4% of visitation and native stingless bees and two hoverfly species accounting for another 37.1% of visitors; 28 other species were collectively responsible for less than 10% of visitation. While insect pollinators were abundant, the relationship between floral visitation and model plant reproductive output was weak and not always positive. The pollination success of model plants was only marginally impacted by environmental features, while pollinator visitation had a small negative impact. However, total crop yields across urban gardens were strongly influenced by local canopy cover and garden scale plant species richness. Synthesis and applications. The factors influencing pollination service delivery to urban gardens are complex; pollinator visitation, richness and/or floral resource availability may not always reflect positive, plant reproductive outcomes. Yields of garden crops, whether pollinator dependent or not, were more strongly influenced by surrounding environmental variables, including broad scale measures of canopy cover and local plant diversity, than pollination-related metrics.

Despite societal dependence on pollinators for crop production, humankind continues to drive pollinator declines through agricultural intensification and urbanisation.
Urban environments can provide refuge to some pollinators. There is a need, however, to understand how pollinator communities can be supported in these areas while also considering human needs. Public green spaces provide a promising avenue to target plant–pollinator conservation measures in an urban setting due to their large area, high abundance and low plant–pollinator biodiversity.
We used a paired design to compare the plant community, pollinator community and plant–pollinator interactions of (i) public urban green spaces enhanced with wildflower meadows and pollinator-friendly ornamental plantings to (ii) control unenhanced urban green spaces. The planting types within enhanced sites were also separately compared.
Our results show that not only was the diversity of the overall pollinator community higher in enhanced than control sites, but also the complexity of some wild Hymenoptera and the abundance of Diptera pollinator groups. The negative impact of urbanisation on some pollinator groups was reduced in enhanced sites compared with control sites. Planting both pollinator-friendly ornamental plants and wildflower meadows significantly increased the visits from Diptera and the diversity in the plant–pollinator community compared with wildflower plantings alone.
Our results suggest that enhancing public spaces for pollinators has positive effects on key groups and can help mitigate the impacts of urbanisation.

In 2012, a novel management regime was initiated in which approximately half the grass area was left uncut, with the plan being to mow it once per year in autumn. In spring 2013, we set up four blocks, with each block subdivided into four 30 × 5 m strips treated under different mowing regimes: (a) regular mowing every 2 weeks all spring and summer, (b) regular mowing until 2 June, (c) regular mowing until 5 July, and (d) no mowing.
The abundance of both flowers and flower-visiting insects increased significantly with reduced mowing, being ca. 3 and 5 times greater in (d) than (a), respectively, with (b) and (c) intermediate. Mowing intensity, however, had a weak effect on wildflower species richness, which was only lower in (a).

1473,"Habitat quality and surrounding landscape structures influence wild bee occurrence in perennial wildflower strips","Perennial wildflower strips (WFS) are known to have positive effects on wild bees in intensively used agricultural landscapes. Little knowledge exists, however, about the drivers of wild bee occurrence and if Red List species also profit from this agri-environmental scheme (AES). Therefore, we studied wild bees on transects along 20 four-to five-year-old WFS and in 10 cereal fields without AES (CONTROL sites) in differently structured landscapes across Saxony-Anhalt (Germany). In addition to local site parameters, we measured parameters of landscape structure in a 1 km radius of the WFS and CONTROL sites. The overall species richness of wild bees (125 species in total, 23 on average), including numerous specialist and Red List species, indicates a high attractiveness of perennial WFS sown with 30 native forbs. In CONTROL fields, 11 bee species (on average only one) were found. The species richness and abundance of wild bees were positively affected by local site conditions of the WFS and CONTROL sites, such as the overall number of sown and spontaneous forbs, the amount of flower rewards of sown forbs available to pollinators (Pollinator Feeding Index), and negatively by the cover of grasses. Therefore, seed mixtures of future AES should comprise a high diversity of wildflower species relevant as pollen sources for wild bees. The share of Red List wild bee species was strongly influenced by the landscape context and increased e.g. with Shannon landscape diversity and the availability of non-forest woody habitats and water bodies in the 1 km surroundings.

We assessed the effectiveness of these flower field types in providing bumblebee foraging habitat compared to control cereal fields. We sampled bumblebees with transect walks and assessed the richness of exploited pollen plants using DNA meta-barcoding and direct observations. All flower field types enhanced bumblebee abundance and species richness compared to control fields but attracted mostly three generalist species. Although we expected highest benefits from the more heterogeneous mixed flower fields, abundance was highest in annual, only intermediate in mixed, and lowest in perennial flower fields. Bumblebee species richness did not differ between flower field types. Overall, the proportion of sown plants in pollen loads was surprisingly low (< 50%). Bombus pascuorum, but not B. terrestris agg., exploited 10% of the sown plant species in perennial, 36% in annual and 45% in mixed flower fields, respectively. Compared to direct observations, pollen samples revealed 4.5 times more visited plant species and thus assessed floral resource use more reliably. Plant species richness in pollen loads decreased with local flowering plant species richness and increased with proportion of annual crops in the landscape, potentially due to the exploitation of more diverse and scattered resources, including flowering crops, in homogenized landscapes to fulfil dietary requirements. Our results indicate that under the current management, both annual and mixed flower fields provide the most attractive food resources, while perennial flower fields offered the poorest foraging habitats.

516,"Local and landscape-level floral resources explain effects of wildflower strips on wild bees across four european countries","Growing evidence for declines in wild bees calls for the development and implementation of effective mitigation measures. Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity.

We tested the performance of experimentally sown annual flower strips specifically designed to promote natural enemies of aphids and their pest control services (tailored flower strips) in adjacent potato crops (n=8) compared with control fields (n=10). Flower strips consisted of 11 plant species providing abundant floral and extra-floral resources. The abundance of key natural enemies of aphids (hoverflies, lacewings and ladybirds) and hoverfly species richness was greatly enhanced in tailored flower strips compared with potato control strips.

We conclude that tailored flower strips can be an effective agri-environmental measure to enhance natural enemies and aphid control in nearby crops. Indeed, tailored flower strips may help to reduce insecticide input in potato production as they significantly decrease the probability that action thresholds are reached.

Most previous studies have shown higher pollinator abundances in flower strips, but none have been able to demonstrate increased pollinator abundances at larger spatial scales, in the surrounding agricultural landscapes. We assessed local and landscape-wide effects of flower strips on pollinator abundances, using 18 carefully selected study landscapes in southern Sweden, distributed along independent gradients of landscape heterogeneity and farming intensity.

Results: We demonstrate the considerable success of these measures for wild bee and butterfly species richness over an observation period of 5 years. Overall species richness of bees and butterflies but also the numbers of specialist bee species clearly increased in the ecological enhancement areas as compared to the control areas without ecological enhancement measures.

1583,"The contributions of flower strips to wild bee conservation in agricultural landscapes can be predicted using pollinator habitat suitability models","Sowing flower strips along field edges is a widely adopted method for conserving pollinating insects in agricultural landscapes. To maximize the effect of flower strips given limited resources, we need spatially explicit tools that can prioritize their placement, and for identifying plant species to include in seed mixtures.We sampled bees and plant species as well as their interactions in a semi-controlled field experiment with roadside/field edge pairs with/without a sown flower strip at 31 sites in Norway and used a regional spatial model of solitary bee species richness to test if the effect of flower strips on bee species richness was predictable from the modelled solitary bee species richness.We found that sites with flower strips were more bee species rich compared to sites without flower strips and that this effect was greatest in areas that the regional solitary bee species richness model had identified to be particularly important for bees. Spatial models revealed that even within small landscapes there were pronounced differences between field edges in the predicted effect of sowing flower strips.Of the plant species that attracted the most bee species, the majority mainly attracted bumblebees and only few species also attracted solitary bees. Considering both the taxonomic diversity of bees and the species richness of bees attracted by plants we suggest that seed mixes containing Hieracium spp. such as Hieracium umbellatum, Pilosella officinarum, Taraxacum spp., Trifolium repens, Lotus corniculatus, Stellaria graminea and Achillea millefolium would provide resources for diverse bee communities in our region.Spatial prediction models of bee diversity can be used to identify locations where flower strips are likely to have the largest effect and can thereby provide managers with an important tool for prioritizing how funding for agri-environmental schemes such as flower strips should be allocated. Such flower strips should contain plant species that are attractive to both solitary and bumblebees, and do not need to be particularly plant species rich as long as the selected plants complement each other. Sowing flower strips along field edges is a widely adopted method for conserving pollinating insects in agricultural landscapes. We sampled bees and plant species as well as their interactions in a semi-controlled field experiment with roadside/field edge pairs with/without a sown flower strip at 31 sites in Norway (A-C).

To maximize the effect of flower strips given limited resources, we need spatially explicit tools that can prioritize their placement, and for identifying plant species to include in seed mixtures.We sampled bees and plant species as well as their interactions in a semi-controlled field experiment with roadside/field edge pairs with/without a sown flower strip at 31 sites in Norway and used a regional spatial model of solitary bee species richness to test if the effect of flower strips on bee species richness was predictable from the modelled solitary bee species richness.We found that sites with flower strips were more bee species rich compared to sites without flower strips and that this effect was greatest in areas that the regional solitary bee species richness model had identified to be particularly important for bees. Spatial models revealed that even within small landscapes there were pronounced differences between field edges in the predicted effect of sowing flower strips.Of the plant species that attracted the most bee species, the majority mainly attracted bumblebees and only few species also attracted solitary bees. Considering both the taxonomic diversity of bees and the species richness of bees attracted by plants we suggest that seed mixes containing Hieracium spp. such as Hieracium umbellatum, Pilosella officinarum, Taraxacum spp., Trifolium repens, Lotus corniculatus, Stellaria graminea and Achillea millefolium would provide resources for diverse bee communities in our region.Spatial prediction models of bee diversity can be used to identify locations where flower strips are likely to have the largest effect and can thereby provide managers with an important tool for prioritizing how funding for agri-environmental schemes such as flower strips should be allocated. Such flower strips should contain plant species that are attractive to both solitary and bumblebees, and do not need to be particularly plant species rich as long as the selected plants complement each other. Sowing flower strips along field edges is a widely adopted method for conserving pollinating insects in agricultural landscapes. We sampled bees and plant species as well as their interactions in a semi-controlled field experiment with roadside/field edge pairs with/without a sown flower strip at 31 sites in Norway (A-C). We illustrate how spatial prediction models can be used to identify where flower strips are likely to contribute the most to conserving wild bee diversity, even within farmlands (D-F).

207,"Field edge flower plantings have variable effects on wild bee abundance, richness, nesting success, and crop pollination, independent of the surrounding landscape","To mitigate the effects of habitat loss on bee conservation and crop pollination, farmers are encouraged to plant flowers along the edges of crop fields. However, it is unclear where and to what degree these flower plantings are effective. Recent studies suggest that flower plantings may be less effective if they are established in landscapes with either very low or very high amounts of non-crop habitat. Moreover, while field edge flower plantings often increase the abundance and richness of bees in field edges, it is unclear whether this improves crop pollination or bee nesting success, which could increase bee populations over time. In this study we examined how field edge flower plantings and the landscape context in which they are established affect wild bee conservation and crop pollination.

265,"Do sown flower strips boost wild pollinator abundance and pollination services in a spring-flowering crop? A case study from uk cider apple orchards","Flower strips are widely recommended as a tool to boost insect pollinators and yield in pollinator-dependeht crops. Using UK cider apple orchards (Mains domestica Borkhausen) as a model system, we assessed whether flower strips increased pollination services in orchards. Pollinator communities (visual observation) and pollination services (fruit set) were assessed at increasing distance from surrounding semi-natural habitats (0-200 m) in eight orchards. In four orchards, perennial flower strips had been established and bloomed in the year before the main experiment. In a separate experiment, insect visits to apple flowers were observed to investigate possible functional mechanisms underpinning pollinator efficacy. The visit rate of wild insects to apple flowers (non-Apis bees and flies), but not that of honeybees (Apis mellifera L.), increased by 40% in flower strip orchards compared to control orchards, particularly in areas close to semi-natural habitat (<100 m). Wild insect visitation was also positively related to dandelion (Taraxacum species) abundance in orchards. Fruit set in orchards was positively related to wild insect richness, and andrenid bee (Andrena species) visitation, but neither richness nor andrenid bee visit rate responded positively to flower strips. Wild bees (andrenid bees and bumblebees (Bombus species)) contacted apple stigma (95 and 100% of visits) more often than honeybees (81%), but only bumblebees moved frequently between different tree rows, an important trait for transfer of compatible pollen in apples. Our results demonstrate that flower strips enhanced overall wild insect abundance but not pollination services in cider orchards. Positive effects of ground flora on wild insect abundance in orchards suggest that flower mixtures or orchard management could be optimised for andrenid bees, the single most important pollinator taxa, by increasing the availability of early-flowering plants in orchards. Equally, wild insect richness was highest in areas close to semi-natural habitats.

1330,"Floral plantings in large-scale commercial agroecosystems support both pollinators and arthropod predators","Simple Summary Pollinators and insect predators are in decline, largely due to commercial agricultural land use and practices. Planting a mixture of wildflowers in the unused margins of agricultural fields may help to conserve these insects and the important benefits that they provide (pollination and pest suppression). We compared wildflower plantings around commercial potato fields to unmanaged grass and weed margins to determine whether these plantings supported greater numbers of pollinators and predators. We found that wildflower plantings increased the numbers of both pollinators and predators within field margins. Additionally, margins with more flowers blooming led to more pollinators, although, interestingly, more flowers did not lead to more predators. This suggests that predators may benefit from wildflower plantings without needing the flowers they provide, while pollinators benefit from flowers specifically. When we measured pollinators and predators in the nearby potato crops, we found that wildflower plantings did not lead to greater numbers of pollinators or predators. Our results suggest that wildflower plantings can help conserve pollinators and predators in commercial agricultural areas, but that these beneficial insects do not move into adjacent crops, where they would be most likely to provide pollination or pest suppression services.

13,"Enhancing pollinator biodiversity in intensive grasslands","Increased agricultural intensification has led to well-documented declines in the fauna and flora associated with intensive grasslands in the UK. We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of different field margin management strategies for putting bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity back into intensive grasslands. Using four intensive livestock farms in south-west England, we manipulated conventional management practices (addition of inorganic fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to generate seven grass-based treatments along a gradient of decreasing management intensity. We also tested two more interventionist treatments which introduced sown components into the sward: (i) a cereal, grass and legume mix, and (ii) a diverse conservation mix with kale, mixed cereals, linseed and legumes. These crop mixtures were intended to provide forage and structural resources for pollinators but were not intended to have agronomic value as livestock feed. Using a replicated block design, we monitored bumblebee and butterfly responses in 27 plots (10 x 50 m) in each farm from 2003 to 2006. Bumblebees were most abundant, species-rich and diverse in the sown treatments and virtually absent from the grass-based treatments. The diverse conservation mix treatment supported larger and more diverse bumblebee assemblages than the cereal, grass and legume mix treatment. The sown treatments, and the most extensively managed grass-based treatments, had the highest abundance, species richness and diversity of adult butterflies, whereas butterfly larvae were only found in the grass-based treatments. Bumblebee and butterfly assemblage structure was driven by floral abundance, floral richness, the availability of nectar resources, and sward structure. Only vegetation cover was correlated with butterfly larval abundance. Synthesis and applications. This study has identified management options in the margins of intensive grasslands which can enhance bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity. Extensification of conventional grass management by stopping fertilization, reducing cutting frequency and not grazing, benefits butterflies. However, to enhance bumblebees requires a more interventionist approach in the form of sowing flower-rich habitat.

The diverse conservation mix treatment supported larger and more diverse bumblebee assemblages than the cereal, grass and legume mix treatment. The sown treatments, and the most extensively managed grass-based treatments, had the highest abundance, species richness and diversity of adult butterflies, whereas butterfly larvae were only found in the grass-based treatments. Bumblebee and butterfly assemblage structure was driven by floral abundance, floral richness, the availability of nectar resources, and sward structure. Only vegetation cover was correlated with butterfly larval abundance. Synthesis and applications. This study has identified management options in the margins of intensive grasslands which can enhance bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity. Extensification of conventional grass management by stopping fertilization, reducing cutting frequency and not grazing, benefits butterflies. However, to enhance bumblebees requires a more interventionist approach in the form of sowing flower-rich habitat. Both approaches are potentially suitable for adoption in agri-environment schemes in the UK and Europe.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE
8,"Effectiveness of new agri-environment schemes in providing foraging resources for bumblebees in intensively farmed landscapes","Intensive farming has contributed to the serious declines in abundance and geographic range suffered by several bumblebee species in Europe and North America.

We surveyed thirty cultivated margins and thirty floristically enhanced grass margins across the UK for pollinators, which included bumblebees Bombus spp., solitary bees and hoverflies Syrphidae. Pollinator abundance was then related to margin attributes such as age, width, soil fertility and adjacent habitat type. For cultivated margins we also investigated relationships with cultivation and rotation, and for floristically enhanced margins time cut. Plant preferences of foraging pollinators were recorded in 2019. On cultivated margins, target annual plants were frequently recorded on plots and were repeatedly visited by pollinators with management significantly influencing visitation rates. For example, plots which had been created with ploughing attracted fewer solitary bees and bees overall than those created with minimum tillage. Annually rotated cultivated margins were associated with lower flower abundance, broad leaved species cover and vegetation heights which resulted in lower total bee abundance. We therefore advise that cultivated margins be left in situ on farmland over longer periods. Older floristically enhanced grass margins became dominated by grass and contained fewer flowerheads to support foraging pollinators. Compared to those established via natural regeneration, sown margins were associated with increased bee and Syrphidae abundance, which is probably linked to the high flowerhead abundance and coverage of broad-leaved species on sown plots.

Sweet cherry production benefits from insect pollination, but the extent to which wildflower strips can boost pollinator visitation under polytunnels is unknown. 2. Wildflowers were established in alleyways between tree rows under polytunnels in 10 commercial cherry orchards. Their management involved either a single cut in September (Standard Wildflower Strips (SWS)) or being actively maintained to 20 cm with regular cutting (Actively Managed Wildflower Strips (AMWS)), compared with unsown Control Strips (CS). Flower visitors of cherry and wildflowers were recorded by visual observations for 3 years (2017-2019), while cherry production (quantity and quality) was assessed in 2019. 3. In total, 67 visitor species were identified; managed commercial species ( Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris) made up similar to 74% of all records. During the cherry blossom period (anthesis), AMWS had the highest visitor density to cherry blossoms compared with CS and SWS but no significant difference in harvestable fruit was recorded.

While the creation of wildflower habitats has been widely used to re-establish such resources into arable ecosystems (e.g. sown into field margins), comparable low cost methods for enhancing floristic diversity in production grasslands are lacking. We investigated how simple and cheep seed mixtures based around three plant functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-leguminous forbs) could be used to enhance flowering resources to benefit insect pollinator communities over a four year period. We demonstrate that the abundance and species richness of pollinators was correlated with the increased availability of legume and non-legume forb flowers. While the flowering resources provided by agricultural cultivars of legumes declined rapidly once sown, the inclusion of a forb component within seed mixtures was effective in increasing the long-term persistence of these resources. As a result the abundance and species richness of insect pollinators over the four years showed greater stability where forbs were also sown. Sward management also played a role in the persistence of floral resources, with grazing more likely to maintain legume cover than cutting. In conclusion, we demonstrate that low cost seed mixtures can be used to enhance floristic diversity to benefit pollinators, although the continued value of these grasslands over time is dependent on complementarity between sown legumes and forbs. As permanent grassland covers c. 40% of the UK the enhancement of their floristic diversity has a huge potential to benefit insect pollinators.

Here we present the results of a season-long study into how targeted floral mixes can be used to increase the populations of distinct suites of beneficial insects in cider apple orchards, and whether we can build 'multi-functional' flowering strips by combining targeted mixes, without introducing trade-offs in beneficial insect density. Flower mixes were sown in 40 m strips between rows of apple trees in four intensively-managed, commercial cider orchards in Herefordshire, SouthWest England. The two 'single-target' mixes contained plant species that were deemed attractive to either natural enemy groups, or bumblebee pollinators, based on previous literature; and a third 'multi-functional' (MF) mix that contained all species from each targeted mix, but sown at half the rate. Flowering strips significantly out-performed areas under normal management (controls) in terms of both flowering density and beneficial insect abundance, although MF plots could not match flowering densities in targeted mixes for individual plant species.

Here we present the results of a season-long study into how targeted floral mixes can be used to increase the populations of distinct suites of beneficial insects in cider apple orchards, and whether we can build 'multi-functional' flowering strips by combining targeted mixes, without introducing trade-offs in beneficial insect density. Flower mixes were sown in 40 m strips between rows of apple trees in four intensively-managed, commercial cider orchards in Herefordshire, SouthWest England. The two 'single-target' mixes contained plant species that were deemed attractive to either natural enemy groups, or bumblebee pollinators, based on previous literature; and a third 'multi-functional' (MF) mix that contained all species from each targeted mix, but sown at half the rate. Flowering strips significantly out-performed areas under normal management (controls) in terms of both flowering density and beneficial insect abundance, although MF plots could not match flowering densities in targeted mixes for individual plant species. Insects responded to the targeted mixes in line with expectation, with bee pollinators favouring the mix containing flowers with long, tubular corollae, whereas natural enemies preferred the targeted mix containing open-nectar plants.

623,"Re-established grasslands on farmland promote pollinators more than predators","Agricultural intensification is among the major threats to farmland biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Agri-environment schemes in Europe aim to counteract the continuous decrease of permanent grassland habitat and related decline of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We established new grasslands adjacent to permanent old grasslands to study effects on arthropod pollinators and predators. Over three years, we assessed the effects of newly established grasslands on activity density, species richness and assemblages of pollinators (syrphids, bumblebees, solitary bees) and ground-dwelling predatory arthropods (carabids, spiders, ants). Pollinator activity density and species richness of all three pollinator groups approximately doubled in newly established grasslands compared to old grasslands, indicating suitability of new grasslands as pollinator feeding habitat. Predator responses were less consistent. Species richness and activity density of carabids and ants did not increase in new grasslands, indicating slower adaptation to new habitats. Spider activity density increased in the newly established grasslands and in adjacent cereal fields, but no significant differences in species richness compared to old grasslands were observed. Bumblebees and solitary bees showed distinct distance decays in cereal fields. Syrphid activity density declined in cereal fields far away from the newly established grasslands, but not nearby. Carabids increased and ants decreased in species richness and activity density with increasing distance from old grasslands in cereal fields and newly established grasslands alike. In contrast, spider species richness and activity density decreased with increasing distance from old grasslands in cereal fields only, but there was no distance decay in newly established grasslands. While pollinators utilized the additional floral resources within the whole area of newly established grassland quickly, predators reacted much slower. Even after three years, there was no measurable response of carabid and ant activity density and only a minor response of spiders.

Pollinators and arthropods (exemplified by hemipterans and coleopterans) differed between orchards and periods and were affected by the plant community. Plant species richness and the abundance of some plant species favored the presence of both pollinators and arthropod assemblages while flower abundance had only a marginal effect on those communities.

We evaluated up to what distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created flower-rich patches) affect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands. 2. We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in transects along ditch banks extending 300 m from four nature reserves forming small islands in landscapes dominated by agriculture. 3. In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover flies in 1500 m long transects on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects. 4. Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species density and abundance of hover flies declined over the first 125 m beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further declines were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially limited. The species density and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch. 5.

189,"Native flowering border crops attract high pollinator abundance and diversity, providing growers the opportunity to enhance pollination services","Over the past century, habitat loss from agricultural intensification has contributed to pollinator decline. One way to mitigate the harmful effects of agricultural intensification is through the re-introduction of native flowering plants as border strips that provide supplemental floral and nesting resources to pollinators. However, border crop species vary in bloom period and flower densities, and are thus likely to attract different suites of pollinator species. Resulting differences in pollinator community composition are likely to affect their ability to provide pollination services to adjacent crop habitat. To address these issues, we implemented a two-year study on the impact of different flowering border crops on pollinator abundance, richness, and community composition. We also examined which crop features (bloom duration, number of flowers, floral area) were most likely to affect pollinator densities. We found that native flowering plant border crops of diverse prairie mix and monocultures of silflower (Silphium integrifolium Michx.) and cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) attracted the highest abundance and species richness of bees and pollinator groups combined, while alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) attracted the highest lepidopteran abundance and species richness. We also found a significant, positive relationship between pollinator abundance and floral resource amount and bloom duration.

One way to mitigate the harmful effects of agricultural intensification is through the re-introduction of native flowering plants as border strips that provide supplemental floral and nesting resources to pollinators. However, border crop species vary in bloom period and flower densities, and are thus likely to attract different suites of pollinator species.

We also studied the treatment effects on selected soil chemical properties. In general, a sown meadow seed mixture mostly benefitted aboveground biodiversity, whereas the impacts of late-season mowing were most discernible for earthworms. Plant species richness or coverage did not differ between seed mixtures, but plant coverage showed a positive response to mowing, while the impact on species richness was minor.

Measurements included seedbank density and diversity, aboveground density and diversity, biomass, cover, canopy height, density of plants in the flowering stage, and abundance of bees, ladybeetles, and spiders. We found that weeds emerging from the soil seedbank hampered flower strip establishment at both sites. The aboveground density of seeded species was highest when monocots plus dicots were seeded at the highest tested rates. Although seeded plants occurred at lower densities than non-seeded plants, they were larger than non-seeded plants in 2023.

2185,"The effect of agri-environment schemes on farmland bee populations","Over the past century there have been substantial declines in farmland biodiversity as a result of the intensification of agricultural practice. Concerns over these declines have led to the development of agri-environment schemes designed to mitigate the effects of intensive agriculture and to benefit biodiversity. Prior to commencing this thesis it was not clear if flower-rich, pollinator-focused agri-environment schemes had a population level impact on wild bees on farmland. Whilst previous work has shown that the creation of flower-rich habitat can provide suitable foraging resources for bumblebees, little was known about the impact of this management on bumblebee population sizes and even less on whether these resources were used by and benefited solitary bees. This thesis compares bee populations between farms with and without flower-rich, pollinator focused agri-environment schemes in Hampshire and West Sussex, UK. Using genetic techniques to estimate colony density, and hence population size, farms implementing targeted schemes had a significantly higher density of bumblebee nests for the four species studied (212 nests/km2 against 112 nests/km2). However, there was no difference in the species richness of bees between these different farm types. When assessing pollen use by solitary bees, flowering plants sown as part of pollinator-focused agri-environment schemes were not widely used, representing 27% of pollen foraging observations and 23% of pollen collected by volume. Only 35% of solitary bee species were found to use sown plants for pollen to a meaningful extent, with most pollen collected from plants persisting in the wider environment. The creation of flower-rich habitat significantly increased resource availability, but did not increase resource diversity.

Whilst previous work has shown that the creation of flower-rich habitat can provide suitable foraging resources for bumblebees, little was known about the impact of this management on bumblebee population sizes and even less on whether these resources were used by and benefited solitary bees. This thesis compares bee populations between farms with and without flower-rich, pollinator focused agri-environment schemes in Hampshire and West Sussex, UK. Using genetic techniques to estimate colony density, and hence population size, farms implementing targeted schemes had a significantly higher density of bumblebee nests for the four species studied (212 nests/km2 against 112 nests/km2). However, there was no difference in the species richness of bees between these different farm types. When assessing pollen use by solitary bees, flowering plants sown as part of pollinator-focused agri-environment schemes were not widely used, representing 27% of pollen foraging observations and 23% of pollen collected by volume. Only 35% of solitary bee species were found to use sown plants for pollen to a meaningful extent, with most pollen collected from plants persisting in the wider environment. The creation of flower-rich habitat significantly increased resource availability, but did not increase resource diversity. These results indicate that if diverse bee populations are to be maintained on farmland then agri-environment schemes must be developed that effectively increase the number of flowering plant species present at the farm scale.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE

Ecological habitat management aims to regulate ecological functions, including ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination. My research has focused on the planting of wildflowers as habitat management for beneficial insects in allotments, gardens and vineyards, as intensively managed, lesser-studied landscapes. The estimated 400,000 ha of UK gardens provide considerable potential pollinator habitat, although a commonly perceived barrier to wildlife gardening is lack of space. Using citizen science, I investigated the effectiveness of a small 4 m2 wildflower patch in recruiting beneficial insects, allocating participants to one of three treatment groups (two wildflower mixes and control) who sampled insects in their private gardens and allotments. Small wildflower patches provided resource-rich habitats, with different treatments attracting different taxa. To assess the ability of a wildflower to attract pollinators to a crop and increase pollination services, I introduced bee-friendly borage as a companion plant co-located with a strawberry plant. In this citizen science project, I found that strawberries companion planted with borage produced significantly more fruit, and fruit of higher aesthetic quality. Verification of the results of both citizen science projects allowed the analysis of effective sampling methods and possible bias in projects conducted in private urban spaces.

Disentangling the relative impact of losses in plant species richness and intensified management on higher trophic level organisms is important for conservation recommendations. We established different management regimes along an experimental gradient of plant species richness within ""The Jena-Experiment"" in Germany and quantified herbivory as well as grasshoppers and pollinators. Herbivory, grasshopper density and species richness and frequency of flower visiting pollinators were recorded two times in each of four subplots of altogether 80 plots differing in plant species richness. Each of the four subplots was subject to four different levels of fertilizer application and mowing to simulate very low, low, high and very high land use intensity. Fertilization and mowing significantly affected plant-herbivore interactions but plant species richness had no discernible effect. Grasshoppers were most abundant at high intensity subplots (3.1 individuals per m2) and least abundant on very low intensity subplots (1.3 individuals per m2). Leaf damage caused by herbivores was highest in even the very high intensity subplots (3.7%) with four mowing events per year and high amounts of fertilizer application and lowest on subplots with a low management intensity (2.4%) comprising two mowing events per year but no fertilizer application. In contrast, pollinators benefited most from lower management intensities, with only one or two mowing events and no fertilizer addition. In addition, higher numbers of flowering plant species and increased blossom cover was associated with enhanced pollinator species richness and flower visitation.

2578,"Differential responses of bumblebees and diurnal lepidoptera to vegetation succession in long-term set-aside","Establishing temporal habitat patches, such as long-term set-aside, is potentially a valuable approach to support pollinator populations in intensively cultivated landscapes. The benefits of this approach are expected to differ between pollinator groups, because of fundamental differences in their ecology. We studied the responses of two pollinator groups, bumblebees and diurnal Lepidoptera (butterflies and diurnal moths), to the vegetation succession in experimental set-aside during six consecutive years. The pollinators were monitored in 24 large treatment plots (50√ó50 m), sown with three different seed mixtures (competitive and two alternatives) and unmanaged or managed by mowing, and on 10 surrounding field margins. The responses of the two pollinator groups to vegetation succession were distinctly different. Bumblebees showed a very strong positive response to the diverse seed mixture with abundant floral resources, and their abundance peaked in the first year. The species richness and abundance of Lepidoptera were increased gradually, suggesting differential colonization speeds of species and a gradual establishment of populations. Lepidopteran abundance reached the level of the field margins in 3 years, whereas the corresponding species richness level was not reached. The benefits of the alternative seed mixtures were less pronounced in Lepidoptera than in bumblebees. No effects of the mowing treatment on either species group were detected. Within both pollinator groups, the response to vegetation succession was associated with species traits. In bumblebees, long-tongued species (indicating specialization) were increased during succession. In butterflies and diurnal moths, colonization success of species was strongly correlated with their wing span (indicating mobility). The most successful colonizers in butterflies were grass feeders and in diurnal moths the species feeding on leguminous plants at the larval stage. Synthesis and applications. The ecological requirements of different pollinator groups should be taken into account when establishing set-aside. Supporting bumblebees is possible even on short-term set-aside, assuming nectar and pollen sources are made available. The occurrence of butterflies and diurnal moths is strongly driven by additional factors, such as the availability of larval host plants as well as adult mobility, which calls for set-aside management regimes to be in place for several years.

We studied the effects of managing meadows according to the prescriptions of ecological compensation areas (ECA), the most widely adopted agri-environment scheme in Switzerland, on both pollinator species richness and abundance, and the reproductive success of plants in nearby intensively managed meadows (IM). We established arrays of four pots, each containing individuals of three insect-pollinated, non-autogamous 'phytometer' species (Raphanus sativus, Hypochaeris radicata and Campanula glomerata), in ECA and adjacent IM at increasing distances from the ECA at 13 sites. Species richness and abundance of hoverflies, solitary bees and large-sized pollinators (mainly social bees and butterflies) were significantly higher in ECA than in adjacent IM. Species richness and abundance of small-sized pollinators in IM declined significantly with increasing distance from ECA, whereas large-sized pollinators were not significantly affected by distance. Plant species richness and flower abundance were the major drivers of pollinator species richness and abundance; the area of an ECA had no significant influence. Individual plants of R. sativus and C. glomerata produced more and heavier seeds in ECA than in IM.

These include pollinating insects such as bumblebees, for which positive effects of AES on abundance and species richness have been shown. However, there is a lack of evidence for effects of AES on reproduction of target species, at either local or landscape scales. We conducted a large-scale study across landscapes exhibiting a gradient of agricultural intensity to investigate the effects of a targeted flower mixture, sown in patches of three different sizes, on an index of the total biomass of bumblebee sexuals (males and queens) on replicated transects within each landscape. We used this index (MQ) as a measure of bumblebee reproduction. After controlling for floral density on transects, we found that MQ was significantly higher on sown flower patches than on conventionally managed control patches at local scales throughout the three-year study. While sown flower patches did not significantly increase MQ in surrounding landscapes, MQ was higher in landscapes surrounding larger (1 ha) than smaller (0.25 ha) sown patches. Our results suggest that, while responses of different bee species may vary depending on the plant species sown, targeted flower mixtures can enhance bumblebee reproduction by providing locally attractive forage resources to bumblebees of all castes and sexes from nests within foraging distance. If established at large enough scales, sown flower patches may lead to a detectable spill-over of reproductives into surrounding landscapes.

We assess how pest control of aphids on wheat (Rhopalosiphum padi) and pollinator linked yield gain in oilseed rape decline with distance from the crop edge. For natural pest control we also assess how field margin floristic diversity (simple grass vs. species-rich wildflower) affects pest control. We do not consider the impact of field margins on oilseed rape pollination as perennial dominated field margins are not in flower at the time of oilseed rape seed set and so do not act to attract pollinators. Aphid colonies exposed to invertebrate natural enemies went extinct at a faster rate than colonies where they were excluded. The rate of decline in per capita growth rates of aphid colonies was greatest when exposed to natural predators, with this effect being detected up to 50 m into the crop where species-rich field margins were present. While oilseed rape yield gains were correlated with pollinator (bees and flies) visitation rates, there was no evidence that yield gain declined with distance from the crop edge.

2645,"The complementarity between ecological infrastructure types benefits natural enemies and pollinators in a mediterranean vineyard agroecosystem","Under the current scenario of biodiversity loss across agroecosystems, the preservation of ecological infrastructures is crucial to maintain ecosystem functions and deliver ecosystem services such as pollination or biological control of pests, which largely determine agricultural productivity and food security. The role that ecological infrastructures such as hedges or strips have in enhancing functionally important groups, including predators, parasitoids and pollinators has been reasonably well investigated in temperate areas. However, it is much less documented in agroecosystems from the Mediterranean basin, even though this area has been identified as a biodiversity hotspot for conservation priorities. In a study developed during 2014 in a traditional vineyard agroecosystem in Northern Spain using a combination of different sampling methods, we analysed beneficial arthropod assemblages across four types of linear ecological infrastructures: woodland hedges, rosaceous hedges, grass strips and flower strips. We investigated the value of these elements as a source of predators, parasitoids and pollinators. We show that ecological infrastructures across this Mediterranean vineyard agroecosystem support functionally important groups and that the abundance, richness and distribution of families of each functional group is determined by features characterising the different types of those infrastructures. Ecological infrastructures with a suitable level of structural diversity constitute an important reservoir of predators.

The role that ecological infrastructures such as hedges or strips have in enhancing functionally important groups, including predators, parasitoids and pollinators has been reasonably well investigated in temperate areas. However, it is much less documented in agroecosystems from the Mediterranean basin, even though this area has been identified as a biodiversity hotspot for conservation priorities. In a study developed during 2014 in a traditional vineyard agroecosystem in Northern Spain using a combination of different sampling methods, we analysed beneficial arthropod assemblages across four types of linear ecological infrastructures: woodland hedges, rosaceous hedges, grass strips and flower strips. We investigated the value of these elements as a source of predators, parasitoids and pollinators. We show that ecological infrastructures across this Mediterranean vineyard agroecosystem support functionally important groups and that the abundance, richness and distribution of families of each functional group is determined by features characterising the different types of those infrastructures. Ecological infrastructures with a suitable level of structural diversity constitute an important reservoir of predators.

We present the results of a large-scale study that investigated the effects of a targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) on bumble bees (Bombus spp.) over three years in the United Kingdom. Forage patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist.

Moreover, we examined flower visitation, species richness and community composition of the most important insect pollinator taxa at different within-field locations varying in distance to WFS.

To quantify effects on biological control, we deployed sentinel prey Spodoptera frugiperda larvae, excluding ground-dwelling predators. As predicted, we found that converting turfgrasses to flowering habitats increased bees and natural enemies on golf courses. However, high wildflower species richness was an important factor in promoting native bees and natural enemies. We found that wildflower habitats, particularly those with highest floral richness, increased biological control rates in adjacent turfgrass areas by up to 50% compared to turfgrass controls.

72,"First steps of pollinator-promoting interventions in eastern european urban areas - positive outcomes, challenges, and recommendations","Urbanisation has a strong role in pollinator decline, while properly managed green spaces could promote pollinators - especially bees and butterflies - by providing foraging and nesting habitats in cities. In public spaces, several opportunities exist to help pollinators including rare mowing, flower strip sowing, and bee hotel establishment. However, pollinator-promoting interventions are almost lacking and still understudied in Eastern Europe. We aimed to investigate the impact of rare mowing and annual flower-sowing interventions on pollinators, floral resources, and vegetation attributes in three case studies within Hungary. We compared treatment (extensively mown or sown) and control (intensively mown) site pairs during five sampling occasions within a season.

The extensively mown sites presented higher and greener vegetation with more flowers and pollinators. The sown flower patches provided floral resources and supported the pollinators in the second half of the season, while they were scarcely visited in spring and early summer due to the annual soil scarification and re-sowing. Although the two types of interventions could complement each other during the season, there is room for further improvements. To reach resilient urban ecosystems against climate and environmental changes, we recommend using primarily native and mostly perennial seeds, combining intervention types, planning for the long-term, and avoiding management inaccuracies (e.g. unplanned mowing).

Rich pollinator assemblages are documented in some cities despite habitat fragmentation and degradation, suggesting that urban areas have potential as pollinator refuges. To inform urban bee conservation, we assessed local- and landscape-scale drivers of bee community composition and foraging within vacant lots of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Cleveland is a shrinking city, a type of urban area that has an over-abundance of vacated greenspaces as a result of population loss and subsequent demolition of abandoned infrastructure. As such, Cleveland represents over 350 post-industrial cities worldwide that are all promising locations for bee conservation. 2. Across a network of 56 residential vacant lots (each similar to 30 m x 12 m), we established seven unique habitats, including seeded native prairies, to investigate how vegetation management and landscape context at a 1,500 m radius influenced urban bee communities. We assessed the distribution of several bee functional traits, diversity and abundance with pan and malaise traps. Foraging frequency was determined with plant-pollinator interaction networks derived from vacuum collections of bees at flowers. 3. We observed higher bee richness and increased abundance of smaller sized bees as the size of surrounding greenspace patches increased within a 1,500 m radius landscape buffer. Within habitats, seeded treatments had no effect on bees but greater plant biomass and shorter vegetation were correlated with increased bee richness and abundance. Plant-pollinator interaction networks were dominated by spontaneous non-native vegetation, illustrating that this forage supports urban bees. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that proximity to larger greenspaces within an urban landscape promotes overall bee richness and increased occurrence of smaller bee species within residential vacant lots. While we did not observe our seeded native plants enhancing the bee community, native wildflowers were still establishing during the study and may have a greater influence when blooming at higher densities. Importantly, spontaneous non-native vegetation provided the majority of urban bee's forage.

However, as a major part of urban green space, roadside vegetation permeates the urban fabric and, if enhanced, can be used to support insects, such as wild bees. To analyze local and landscape-scale effects of enhanced urban roadsides on wild bee communities and to identify bee traits affected by urban filtering, we established 78 wildflower patches with a native seed mixture along five major roads in Munich (S Germany). Species-poor roadsides with regular management were used as control. During a three-year experiment, we sampled wild bees with pan traps, monitored roadside vegetation, and analyzed landscape diversity and perimeter-area ratio of green space within a radius of 500 m. We gathered information on wild bee morphological, behavioral, phenological, and foraging traits and calculated their abundance, species richness and functional dispersion. Wild bee abundance, richness and functional dispersion increased with vegetation diversity. Functional dispersion was positively correlated with landscape diversity and distance from the city center, indicating trait-based urban filtering. A fourth corner analysis revealed that small, short-lived, and univoltine bees were disadvantaged at urban roadsides. While univoltine bees were discriminated in areas of high landscape diversity, large bees prevailed in the city outskirts, and solitary bees were associated with green space edges.

Our study explores how wild bee communities are affected by greenspace and landscape-level features like pollinator management practices, in urban greenspaces in and around Appleton Wisconsin: a mid-sized urban community spanning more than 100 sq. km. We sampled and identified native bees periodically between late-May 2017 and mid-September of 2018 using standardized arrays of pan traps at 15 sites around the city. We classified greenspaces based on their level of development (urban or suburban) and whether they were managed or unmanaged for increasing wild pollinator diversity. We quantified floral species diversity, floral color diversity, tree species diversity, and proximity of sites to open water for each site and used remotely sensed satellite data from both the USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

Within-greenspace attributes such as floral diversity, tree diversity, and proximity to open water contributed positively to both bee abundance and richness.

Overall, we found the number of flowers added at the local level was significantly and positively correlated with small Halictid bee abundance and species density in an urban landscape. At smaller flower quantities, dynamics were clearly linear, where incremental increases in number of flowers showed significant increases in bee abundance and species density. At larger quantities of floral additions, however, dynamics were nonlinear in that incremental increases in flower quantity had no effect on bee abundance and highly variable effects on bee species density. When comparing the change in small Halictid bee abundance and species density from 1¬†year to the next, we found a significant increase in bee species density in the second year of small-scale floral additions, but no significant difference in bee abundance.
